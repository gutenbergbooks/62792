<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SEA SCOUTS AT PLAY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commodore Wingate of the Hampton Yacht
Club gave the word in a sharp, tense voice. The
pistol he held extended above his head cracked
sharply. The crowds massed upon the clubhouse
verandas and in the vicinity broke into hoarse
cheers as the tension of waiting was relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go!&rdquo; came the cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Before the puff of blue smoke from the discharged
pistol had been wafted away by a light
breeze, two eighteen-foot, double-ended whaleboats
shot out from either side of the float. For
ten minutes or more they had been teetering
there, like leashed greyhounds. This was while
the final words of instruction were being given.
Now the suspense of the preliminaries was over,
and the &ldquo;Spearing the Sturgeon&rdquo; contest, between
the Hawk and Eagle Patrols of Hampton,
was on.</p>
<p>Bow and bow the two white craft hissed over
the sparkling, blue waters of the inlet. From the
clubhouse porch, from the beach, from the sand
dunes of the farther side of the Inlet, and from
the row of automobiles parked along the beach&mdash;which
had come from all parts of Long Island&mdash;the
strivers were cheered.</p>
<p>The afternoon&rsquo;s program of exciting water
sports, arranged by the Scoutmasters of the rival
patrols, was now reaching its climax. The packed
yacht club and automobile crowds ashore had
never seen anything like it before. Among them
was our old friend of the first volume of this
series&mdash;&ldquo;The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol&rdquo;&mdash;namely,
Captain Job Hudgins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the beatingest I ever seed afloat or ashore,
douse my toplights if it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the captain was
loudly declaring to a group of cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them Bye Scuts did wonders in the west, they
tell me,&rdquo; commented Si Stebbins, the postmaster
and village store-keeper. &ldquo;In my day, though,
a bye had ter work an&rsquo; not go foolin&rsquo; aroun&rsquo; in er
uniform like them Scuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What air yer talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; put in another
voice. &ldquo;Them Boy Scouts is a good thing fer
this town. Didn&rsquo;t ther newspapers hev all erbout
how they beat out a band of cattle rustlers and
Injuns in ther west, an&rsquo; most got killed doin&rsquo; it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d hev bin a sight better ter hum minding
their own bizness,&rdquo; opined Jeb Trotter, a village
character, but there were few who had watched
the exciting afternoon of healthy, wholesome
water sports who agreed with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>As the readers of the &ldquo;Boy Scouts on the
Range&rdquo; may recollect, it was mentioned in that
book that, during Leader Rob&rsquo;s absence on a
friend&rsquo;s ranch in the west, another patrol&mdash;namely,
the Hawk&mdash;had been formed. On his return,
as was natural, the lads of the Eagle had
besieged him with proposals to try conclusions
with the Hawks. Finally, under Scoutmaster
Blake with Wingate&rsquo;s supervision, a program had
been arranged. It included a game of water polo,
tub races, a greased pole competition, a race between
small cat-boats, and, as a grand wind-up
feature, the exciting &ldquo;Spearing the Sturgeon&rdquo;
game.</p>
<p>Honors were even up to the moment that the
two boats dashed away from the float. The
laurels of the afternoon would go to the victorious
crew. No wonder a cheer went up as the
double-enders skimmed over the sparkling water
toward a dark object, about six feet in length,
near which a canoe, containing the referee, Bartley
Holmes, hovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The dark object was &ldquo;the sturgeon.&rdquo; It was
formed of soft wood, and had two realistic eyes
painted on the thicker part of its body. It really
did look something like a sturgeon, as it lay bobbing
about on the water. At the bow of each
boat stood a lithe young figure in bathing togs.
Each held poised above his head a keen, pointed
harpoon. The eyes of both of the spearsmen
were riveted, as their crews urged their boats forward,
upon the sturgeon&rsquo;s dark outline.</p>
<p>In the stern of each boat, from which fluttered
flags bearing their patrol figures in proper colorings,
was poised a steersman, holding a single
oar. In the Eagles&rsquo; boat the helmsman was Merritt
Crawford. In the Hawks&rsquo; craft the position
was held by a lad named Dale Harding. Skillfully
each coxswain directed his flying craft to a
point of vantage from which their spearsman
could hurl his harpoon to the most effective purpose.</p>
<p>The young harpooners stood tense and rigid as
pieces of statuary, every sinew and muscle in
their bodies ready for the first &ldquo;strike.&rdquo; The
Eagles&rsquo; harpooner, Rob Blake, the leader of that
patrol, was perhaps a little smaller in girth and
height than Freeman Hunt, the harpooner and
leader of the Hawks, but what Rob lacked in
&ldquo;beef,&rdquo; he made up in sinuous activity. The fall
sun glinted on his tough, brown flesh, as if it had
been bronze. &ldquo;Hard as nails&rdquo; you would have
said if you could have looked him over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>As the green and black &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; standard, and
the pink &ldquo;Hawk&rdquo; flag began to close in from
their different points of the compass, a sharp cry
went up from the onlookers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;K-r-ee-ee-ee-ee!&rdquo; shrilled the patrol cry of the
Eagles from veranda, dune and beach.</p>
<p>Then a breathless hush fell as they waited for
the first strike. The referee, in his dark-green
canoe, dodged about as actively as a water bug,
watching every move closely.</p>
<p>The crews were made up as follows:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>A deep-throated roar went up from the shore
as Rob Blake&rsquo;s harpoon glinted in the sunlight
and sank quivering into the soft wood of the
sturgeon. Instantly Merritt Crawford swung on
his oar, bringing the bow of the boat round. But
as he did so, there came another flash, and Freeman
Hunt&rsquo;s harpoon sank deep into the quarry,
not six inches from Rob&rsquo;s spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, you Eagles!&rdquo; came a wild shout from
shoreward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Hawks!&rdquo; roared back the rival
contingent.</p>
<p>Both crews were backing water for all they
were worth, each seeking to draw the other&rsquo;s
harpoon out of the &ldquo;sturgeon.&rdquo; The harpoons
were not barbed, which might have made them
dangerous, and a determined pull would be likely
to dislodge one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give them rope!&rdquo; shouted Merritt from the
stern of the Eagles&rsquo; boat, and Rob, as the Hawks
started to pull away, paid out his harpoon line
rapidly. This maneuver rested his men while it
saved his spear from being damaged. The
Hawks, on the other hand, were straining their
backs with feverish energy. They fairly dripped
as they bent to their oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, come ahead easy!&rdquo; ordered Rob,
and the Eagles&rsquo; boat began to creep up.</p>
<p>But still the two harpoons stood upright in
the &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; of the wooden game. Bartley Holmes
came scudding up in his canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carefully now, boys! Carefully!&rdquo; he urged,
watching things narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to work up into their base!&rdquo;
shouted Merritt suddenly, as the boats neared the
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working into their base&rdquo; meant that the opposing
crew would try to land the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; at their
starting point. In such case, the first heat would
go to them, even if the Eagles&rsquo; spear was sticking
in the sturgeon at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back water!&rdquo; cried Rob suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The lad, crouching over the water, had been
watching every move of his opponents anxiously.
He detected signs of weakening in the crew of
the Hawks, and gave the signal to reverse the
motion of his boat as the Hawks slacked up ever
so little.</p>
<p>The line zanged up out of the water, dripping
and taut, as Rob&rsquo;s crew obeyed the sharp order.</p>
<p>As it did so, there was a cry of dismay from
the Hawk supporters, when they beheld Freeman
Hunt&rsquo;s spear, which had not sunk as deep as
Rob&rsquo;s, jerked out of the &ldquo;fish.&rdquo; Hunt gritted
his teeth angrily. He was not a boy who relished
defeat at any game, and the yells of the
Eagle adherents enraged him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get after them, you dubs!&rdquo; he bellowed, as
the Eagle boat darted off, towing the captured
sturgeon behind them.</p>
<p>It was Hunt&rsquo;s object to overtake them and
spear the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; again. In this case a fresh
struggle, in which he might prove victorious,
would ensue.</p>
<p>Everybody was now on the tiptoe of excitement.
It was a race for the Eagles&rsquo; base. With
Rob&rsquo;s muscular young crew bending to their oars
with the regularity of machine-driven mechanism,
the boat bearing the green and black standard
fairly hissed through the water. Behind her
there towed clumsily the black form of the captured
sturgeon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;More steam! More steam!&rdquo; shouted Hunt,
dancing up and down in the bow of the craft, as
the Hawk Patrol boys gave way with all their
power. But pull as they would, they were no
match for the Eagles, who had rested while they
were needlessly exerting their strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eagles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;K-r-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Hawks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, boys! PULL!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yells came now in one continuous roar, but
they did not affect the result of the first heat at
all.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The starter&rsquo;s pistol cracked once more as the
Eagles&rsquo; whaler, with the sturgeon in tow, shot
across the line. But as she did so, Freeman Hunt
made a desperate effort, and by some fluke&mdash;for
the distance between the boats must have been
twenty feet,&mdash;succeeded in landing his spear in
the sturgeon&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back water! Back water!&rdquo; Dale Harding began
yelling, working his steering oar about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; laughed back Rob good-naturedly.
&ldquo;Try again next heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; shouted Hunt angrily.
&ldquo;My harpoon is in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we had crossed the line as you cast
it,&rdquo; yelled back Merritt.</p>
<p>An immediate appeal to Commodore Wingate
followed, the referee being hopelessly outdistanced
in that wild dash for the float.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; he shouted above the confusion of
excited boyish voices. Instantly there was a
hush, only broken by some excited supporter of
the Hawks having it out with an equally heated
adherent of the Eagles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My decision is that the Eagles win the first
heat,&rdquo; announced Mr. Wingate. &ldquo;The sturgeon
was across the base line before the Hawks harpooned
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly Bedlam broke loose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought to have your eyes seen to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These, and a hundred other argumentative remarks,
filled the air, but, of course, like most such
outbursts, they had no effect on the referee&rsquo;s decision.
There was a glowering, angry look on
Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s face, though, as the two boats
changed bases for the next heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you this trip,&rdquo; he grated, as the
Eagle&rsquo;s boat scraped past his craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Hunt, you&rsquo;re an awful bad loser,&rdquo; piped
up the corpulent Tubby, winking at the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am, am I, you tub of lard. Just you
wait. We&rsquo;ll show you. You may have got that
heat by a technical decision, but we&rsquo;ll beat you
fair and square this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re both here to try just that,&rdquo; Rob
reminded the angry boy, as the boats bumped and
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second of the three heats is now on!&rdquo; bellowed
the announcer through his megaphone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Wingate, as
the occupants of both boats anxiously awaited the
signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right here,&rdquo; announced Freeman Hunt, on
whose face an angry light still showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, sir,&rdquo; cried Rob.</p>
<p>The pistol cracked, and the two boats darted
forth once more, now on the second lap of their
intense struggle for supremacy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SPEARING OF THE STURGEON.</span></h2>
<p>There were to be three heats in the contest.
One having already gone to the Eagles, it behooved
the Hawks to exert themselves to the
uttermost to even matters up. The short rest at
the float had done them good. During the breathing
spell, the sturgeon had once more been towed
out by Bartley Holmes, and now lay bobbing
temptingly, awaiting the young harpooners.
Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s crew, rowing with unwise desperation,
were the first at the mark this time.
The &ldquo;sturgeon&rdquo; gave an awkward wallow and
vanished from view for a breath, as Hunt&rsquo;s harpoon
flashed through the air and sank deep into
it. An encouraging cheer went up from the
shore. Hunt grinned confidently, as Dale Harding
ordered his rowers to speed off with their
prey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>But Rob&rsquo;s boat was almost upon the sturgeon
as Hunt&rsquo;s harpoon sank into it. Tautening every
muscle the boy hurtled his weapon, less then a
second later. But the steel point, instead of sinking
in, merely grazed the bobbing, yielding object,
and shot into the water with a splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-e-l-l!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ironical groan came from the Hawks&rsquo; supporters
ashore. The success of the Pink Bird&rsquo;s
patrol encouraged them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you!&rdquo; shouted Hunt triumphantly,
as Rob, without any expression of anger
or chagrin crossing his features, proceeded to
haul in his harpoon.</p>
<p>Rob made no reply. Instead he turned to Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the ginger you can, old man,&rdquo; he said
quietly, as the Hawks&rsquo; boat dashed off at top
speed, towing the captured sturgeon behind them.
Already they were two or three boat lengths
ahead of the Eagles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fathom! Fathom!&rdquo; shouted Rob suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>His keen eyes had noticed that the Hawks&rsquo;
boat had not paid out line to the fathom mark,
which was indicated by a bit of red rag tied in the
harpoon rope. Instead, they were towing their
quarry quite close to their stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; shouted back Dale Harding, a flash
of defiance in his eye, but the referee&rsquo;s voice
cut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fathom there! Pay out your line!&rdquo; he ordered
sharply.</p>
<p>Rather sulkily Dale obeyed. This gave Rob
another chance. Poising himself carefully, he
threw once more. This time his cast landed in
the wooden back, but the distance was so great
that much of the force of the cast was lost. The
steel point of the harpoon hung quiveringly in not
more than an inch of wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah-h-h-h-h!&rdquo; yelled the Hawkites disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Blake!&rdquo; came a roar from the
Eagle supporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spurt. Pull, you beggars!&rdquo; yelled Dale
suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The Hawks&rsquo; craft shot forward. Dale&rsquo;s sharp
eyes had seen that Rob&rsquo;s spear had only lodged
lightly in the &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; whereas Hunt&rsquo;s harpoon was
firmly embedded. The move was successful. As
the lines tautened, Rob&rsquo;s harpoon point was
jerked out of the &ldquo;sturgeon.&rdquo; With a shout, the
Hawks shot forward for their float.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-e-l-l!&rdquo; yelled the Hawks&rsquo; crowd ashore, in
further ironical astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard luck!&rdquo; encouraged Merritt from the
stern, as Rob hauled in. &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you fellows will put me alongside.
I guess all my fingers have turned to
thumbs,&rdquo; rejoined Rob. Not a trace of anger
over his failure to spear the fish revealed itself.
He seemed as sunny and good-natured as ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The Eagles gave way with a will. They would
need every ounce of their muscle and reserve
force if they were to overtake the seemingly victorious
Hawks. But with leaps and bounds, the
Eagle boat came upon the other a few hundred
feet from the base line. Again Rob cast, and
again he missed&mdash;but this time there was a reason.
As his harpoon had launched through the
air, Harding had given the line attached to the
&ldquo;sturgeon&rdquo; a slight tug. Light as it was, however,
it was sufficient to pull the floating target
out of the harpoon reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foul!&rdquo; shouted Merritt angrily, from the
stern of the Eagles&rsquo; boat. He, too, apparently,
had seen the action of Dale, and instantly called
the attention of the referee to it. Bartley Holmes
was paddling near by, and immediately came
alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dale Harding jerked the rope just as
Rob cast,&rdquo; explained Merritt. &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t they be
penalized for a foul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an accident!&rdquo; cried Harding, turning
rather white under his tan. &ldquo;I was stooping
down to fix a toggle pin and maybe I accidentally
touched the line. I don&rsquo;t believe, though, it made
any difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you touched the line at all, you infringed
on a rule,&rdquo; declared the referee. Then to Rob:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to claim this heat on a foul?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Rob instantly. &ldquo;If it was
an accident, that&rsquo;s good enough for me. We
don&rsquo;t wish to take advantage of anything like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Go ahead, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hawks&rsquo; boat shot forward, and before
Rob could gather up his line and coil it for another
throw, they had towed the &ldquo;sturgeon&rdquo;
across their base line.</p>
<p>Instantly from human throats, auto horns, and
launch whistles a great uproar arose. While it
was at its height, Bartley Holmes once more
towed out the sturgeon, and placed it in position
for the third and decisive struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to win this final,&rdquo; Hunt found time
to whisper to Harding, while the boats changed
bases. &ldquo;If we capture it, we put the Hawks on
top for the winter. If we lose it, we&rsquo;ll have to
take second place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win it,&rdquo; Dale assured him positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be my fault if we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; rejoined
Hunt. Victory affected him as much as defeat.
His cheeks were now flushed with a color that
was not all caused by exertion. He openly triumphed
over the Eagles as they rowed past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The final did not open with the dash that had
marked the two other heats. Both crews were
evidently conserving their efforts for what they
felt was to be a severe struggle. In fact, neither
boat appeared in any hurry to reach the mark.
Both coxswains contented themselves with keeping
bow and bow, eyeing each other warily, however,
on the alert for any unexpected move on the
part of their rivals.</p>
<p>As before, it was Hunt&rsquo;s harpoon that first
found a resting place. But as it settled in the
wood, Rob&rsquo;s weapon flashed silverly, and skillfully
fell so that his line was drawn across the
shaft of the Hawk harpoonist&rsquo;s weapon. Then
with a quick jerk of his forearm, and, before the
Hawks could slacken up, Rob drew his line taut.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>Out came the Hawks&rsquo; spear and fell into the
water in a shower of spray, cunningly dislodged
by Rob&rsquo;s cleverness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Hunt scowled blackly as the two boats drew
alongside to disentangle the weapons. He said
nothing, however, but glanced back at Harding.
The lines were speedily cast apart, and the two
boats drew off for a fresh attack. But as they
did so, Dale Harding inclined his steering oar
and the Hawks&rsquo; boat came crashing down upon
the Eagles&rsquo; craft. Tubby Hopkins&rsquo; oar was
caught between them and almost snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up! Hold up!&rdquo; he shouted angrily.
&ldquo;What are you trying to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off there, Dale. How can you be so
careless?&rdquo; admonished Hunt, but, nevertheless, a
gleam of satisfaction lit up his eyes as he noted
that Tubby&rsquo;s wrist had been twisted, and from
the way in which the fat boy held the member it
must have been giving him some pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let accidents like that happen again,
Harding,&rdquo; warned Bartley Holmes sharply, &ldquo;or
I&rsquo;ll disqualify you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Row right up on it this time; I want to get a
good hold,&rdquo; hailed Rob to Merritt. The coxswain
nodded and as the oarsmen gave way he
directed the prow of the boat almost directly at
the floating &ldquo;sturgeon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait and see what they do,&rdquo; declared
Hunt, addressing his crew. &ldquo;If they hook fast,
I&rsquo;ll try Rob&rsquo;s trick and yank his harpoon out. If
they don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll drive the spear deep and tug
theirs out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sharp &ldquo;z-i-i-g!&rdquo; Rob&rsquo;s harpoon flew
from his hand and sank shivering into the soft
wood of the &ldquo;sturgeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good strike!&rdquo; shouted Bartley Holmes from
his canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back water, Eagles!&rdquo; yelled Merritt, as the
Hawks came driving down upon the quarry.
Hunt&rsquo;s sinewy form stood erect and tensile for a
second, then down drove his arm with every
ounce of muscular effort of which he was capable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; shouted the impartial referee.</p>
<p>The leader of the Hawks had sunk his weapon
fully as far into the floating target as had Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the tug of war,&rdquo; muttered Holmes,
as the two boats drew apart, both harpoon-ropes
stretching taut as violin strings. Suddenly Rob
almost toppled backward as the strain on the
Eagles&rsquo; boat was quickly released and she shot
forward. His harpoon had pulled out. It had
not been lodged deeply enough to resist the strain.
On the other hand, Hunt&rsquo;s weapon seemed to be
somewhat wobbly poised. Evidently, the tugging
had weakened its grip.</p>
<p>But the Hawks paid no attention to this. Nor
indeed could they do anything to repair it without
breaking the rules. Instead, they darted off
at top speed for the shore. A mighty, ear-splitting
roar went up as it was seen that the Hawk
standard was for the second time, apparently,
victorious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two out of three, fellows! We win!&rdquo;
Hunt exclaimed, as his boat shot through the
water.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, the Eagles had not been
idle. Rob had hauled in his dripping line and
now stood once more ready for action. Behind
him Tubby was hitting up a terrific stroke. The
Eagles&rsquo; boat fairly flew in pursuit of the captors
of the trophy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now or never,&rdquo; thought Rob, as at twenty
feet or more he decided to cast. Another second
and it would be too late. With every effort he
could muster, the lad launched his harpoon, aiming,
not at the body of the fish, but at the Hawks&rsquo;
weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done it!&rdquo; went up a shout of exultation
from the Eagles&rsquo; rooters, as for the second time
that day Rob&rsquo;s harpoon dislodged his opponent&rsquo;s
spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the luck!&rdquo; grated out Hunt, as he
saw the victory torn from his grasp, as it were.
His groan of dismay was echoed by every one in
the Hawks&rsquo; boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close in! Close in!&rdquo; yelled Dale, urging his
crew around, while Hunt rapidly manipulated his
line, cast it loose of Rob&rsquo;s, and made ready for a
fresh cast.</p>
<p>A current had caught the sturgeon and carried
it quite a distance from the two boats, and
seaward, while this was going on. A sharp dash
followed. It was a culminating tussle. Straining
every nerve and muscle, the Eagles and the
Hawks flew forward, as swiftly almost as their
namesakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; shouted Merritt.</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s harpoon whistled through the air and
sank, with a &ldquo;squdge,&rdquo; into the side of the bobbing,
evasive target.</p>
<p>A second later Hunt&rsquo;s weapon, too, sought a
resting place in the elusive thing. But, alas for
Hunt&rsquo;s endeavor! The very energy he threw
into his cast unbalanced him, and he toppled with
a splash and a great commotion clean over the
bow of his craft and into the water.</p>
<p>He could swim like a fish, and came up a second
later, puffing and sputtering. With the
stream of water he emitted from his lips as he
rose to the surface was mingled some savage language.
Hastily he grabbed the gunwale of the
Hawks&rsquo; boat, and started to clamber into it.</p>
<p>To his intense joy, he saw, as he emerged from
his ducking, that his spear seemed to be firmly
fixed in the wooden fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; urged Dale. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Eagles rapidly passed the line under the
keel of their boat till it trailed out astern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give way!&rdquo; shouted Merritt, and &ldquo;give way&rdquo;
with a will did the four pairs of healthy young
arms. The Eagle boat fairly cut through the
water. The maneuver caught the Hawks napping.
Before they could do anything their line
was drawn taut, and the harpoon Freeman Hunt
had planted was jerked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; came a deep, swelling roar, surging
toward the contestants, from the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Eagles, you&rsquo;ve got them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After them, Hawks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;K-r-ee-ee-ee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These cries and a thousand others, mingled in
a perfect babel of sound. To the uproar, however,
neither of the crews paid any attention.
Their efforts and energies were all bent in one
direction&mdash;to get across the base line first with
the fish. The Hawks&rsquo; boat made a creditable
spurt, while Hunt gathered up his line ready for
a fresh cast. He would make an attempt to
snatch victory out of defeat. How much his
mind was bent upon success, it was easy to see
by his lined brow and narrowed eyes. Closer and
closer to the flying Eagles crept the Hawks&rsquo; boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Unencumbered by a wooden fish to tow, they
could make much faster time. Now they were almost
upon the prey, and Freeman Hunt drew
himself up for a supreme effort. His brown arm
drew back, showing the muscles bulging and
working under the flesh.</p>
<p>The next instant the harpoonist of the Hawks
made his last cast and&mdash;lost! His weapon
flashed into the water, missing the target by
the fraction of an inch. An instant later the
Eagles&rsquo; boat shot across the base line, amid a
pandemonium of cheers, yells, tooting of auto
horns and sympathetic groans for the losers. The
Eagles had won out in the big event of the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JACK CURTISS REAPPEARS.</span></h2>
<p>It was one Saturday night following the aquatic
field day. The winter term of hard work
had commenced at the Hampton Academy, giving
the Boy Scouts less time to devote to their organization
work than they had found during the
summer. Rob Blake, Merritt Crawford, and
Tubby Hopkins were on their way home through
the gathering dusk from a game of Hare and
Hounds, which had wound up by the catching of
the hare at a village called Aquebogue, some distance
from Hampton.</p>
<p>At a steady jog trot the three lads were making
their way toward their home village. A
slight chill predictive of the coming winter was
in the air, but for the time of year, mid-October,
the evening was unusually calm and warm. It
was this late Indian summer that had made the
water games possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The boys&rsquo; conversation, as they jogged along,
dealt mainly with the astonishing things that had
happened to them on the Harkness ranch in the
wildest part of Arizona. All of these were related
in detail in &ldquo;The Boy Scouts on The
Range.&rdquo; Readers of that book will recall how
Rob Blake, the son of the president of the National
Bank of Hampton; Merritt Crawford, one
of the numerous family of the village blacksmith,
and Tubby Hopkins, the offspring of a widow in
comfortable circumstances, had accepted the invitation
of Harry Harkness to get a taste of life on
the range.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Their strange encounter with Jack Curtiss and
Bill Bender, their former enemies, was related
in that volume, together with the surprising and
clever manner in which they turned the tables on
those worthies. In that book, too, we saw the
raw Easterners&mdash;Tenderfeet, as they were&mdash;become
transformed from &ldquo;greenies&rdquo; into good
shots, capable riders, and excellent woodsmen.
During their western stay they had broadened
and developed considerably from the lads who
some months before had formed the Eagle Patrol,
as related in the first volume of this series, &ldquo;The
Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol.&rdquo; They had returned
to Hampton better, mentally and physically,
for their trip.</p>
<p>But like most lads who have left their native
place for even a short time, they found changes
when they returned. Freeman Hunt, the son of
a well-to-do resident, had formed the Hawk Patrol,
and enrolled in it as many boys as he could.
In the meantime, the Eagle Patrol had developed,
and now numbered twenty stalwart lads, in addition
to the original ten whom we know. In
some way, however, instead of the spirit of
friendliness and good fellowship that should have
prevailed, the Hawk and Eagle Patrols found
themselves involved in considerable rivalry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Now rivalry is good. Nothing could be better
in athletics or daily life than a healthy spirit
of emulation. It is when rivalry degenerates
into bitterness that it is time to call a halt. Under
Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s leadership, the Hawks had
developed such a spirit. Dale Harding, Hunt&rsquo;s
boon companion, had followed his leader&rsquo;s example
in abetting it, instead of trying to allay hard
and angry feelings. In fact, despite all that the
scoutmasters could do, the Hawks sought every
opportunity to lure the Eagles into open hostilities.</p>
<p>Rob Blake and his crowd had managed hitherto
to keep their men in check. But the task was
daily getting harder. Freeman Hunt had many
good qualities, but he could not bear to be beaten
at anything. He was a bad loser. Until the return
of Rob and his chums from the West, he
had had things pretty much his own way. But
since that time, every contest in which the Hawks
and Eagles had engaged had resulted in victory
for the latter. This galled Hunt and Harding
exceedingly. They would have liked to see and
to hasten the return of Rob and his companions to
the West, or anywhere else, so long as they were
left a free field for their endeavors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The Sturgeon Spearing Contest had proved
the climax of affairs between the two patrols.
In the dressing-room, after the awarding of the
pennant to the Eagles, Hunt had bitterly assailed
Rob. The latter had stood taunt after taunt
without a word. He good-naturedly ascribed it
to Hunt&rsquo;s natural chagrin at being beaten. Finally,
an especially bitter remark had moved him
to reply. After all, Rob was only human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Hunt,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think
it would be a heap more manly not to make so
much noise about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; grated out Hunt, almost beside
himself with rage. He came close up to Rob and
shook his fist threateningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, anyhow, to tell me what I&rsquo;m to
do, eh? What have you got to say about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this,&rdquo; had been Rob&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;that I think
you are a pretty bad loser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do, eh? Well, I&rsquo;m a better man than
you&mdash;so take that!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Smack!</i></p>
<p>The infuriated lad had actually allowed his
temper to carry his judgment away so utterly as
to strike his conqueror in the face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The other boys in the place had stood about,
fairly gasping. What would Rob do? To their
astonishment, he did nothing. While an angry,
crimson mark grew upon his cheek where the
blow had fallen, his countenance was calm and
composed. But he caught Hunt&rsquo;s hand in a grip
of iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Hunt,&rdquo; he said quietly enough, but
every word rang home with sledge-hammer force,
&ldquo;you were beaten to-day. Worse, still, you can&rsquo;t
take it like a man. To cap the climax, you have
struck me. Don&rsquo;t&mdash;do&mdash;it&mdash;again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words came slowly, but they made
Hunt flinch. Even Harding, who had been inclined
to urge his crony on, held his breath.
Would Rob strike Freeman? That question was
soon answered. Rob released the angry boy&rsquo;s
wrists, and let him go. Muttering angrily, Hunt
had slunk off to a locker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you have it out with him?&rdquo; Dale
asked him later, after Rob and the others had
dressed and gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too many of his crowd around,&rdquo; Hunt muttered
in reply, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll fix him. You watch me.
He&rsquo;s not going to get away with anything like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you in anything you want to do,&rdquo;
Dale assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may give you an opportunity before long
to show if you mean that or not,&rdquo; rejoined Hunt,
but when Dale pressed him for some explanation,
he refused to enlarge on the thinly-veiled threat.</p>
<p>Of this conversation, the lads, however, knew
nothing, and were, therefore, considerably astonished
when, as they descended a bank leading into
the road to Hampton Inlet, a stoutly built lad,
accompanied by three others of about his own age
and build, stepped from behind a hedge, where
they had evidently been lying in wait for the returning
lads.</p>
<p>As the three figures stepped forward into the
road, and blocked the path of the homing lads,
Rob recognized them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it, Freeman Hunt?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; retorted the other belligerently,
blocking the way, &ldquo;I want to settle with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Settle with me&mdash;what for?&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what you did in the locker room at the
club the other day. You have made me the laughing-stock
of the place. Take off your coat, for
I&rsquo;m going to give you the worst licking you ever
had in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy me!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby, pretending to
quake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;ll be laughing on the wrong side
of your face before I get through with him,&rdquo;
grated Freeman Hunt. &ldquo;I can lick Rob Blake
the best day he ever walked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked Rob calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; yes,&rdquo; pugnaciously rejoined Hunt,
thrusting forward his chin in a manner he had
seen depicted in pictures of pugilists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; was the astonishing reply, &ldquo;let it
go at that. We want to get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that?&rdquo; exclaimed
Lem Lonsdale, who was one of the lads accompanying
Hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to get home to his mammy,&rdquo; sneered
Dale Harding, Hunt&rsquo;s other companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he&rsquo;s got to take his medicine first,&rdquo;
snarled Hunt, who had, unfortunately for himself,
as it later appeared, mistaken Rob&rsquo;s unwillingness
to enter into a bruising match for timidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re afraid to fight, eh?&rdquo; he jeered.
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got to. Will you put up your fists,
and take it like a man, or will I have to trounce
you like a regular coward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, how will you take your licking?&rdquo; sneered
Dale Harding, as Hunt sprang at Rob, thinking
to take him by surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a pistol-shot, the words were snapped out.</p>
<p>The next instant Hunt was seen to halt in his
spring forward, and go toppling backward. Rob,
unwilling to hurt him, had &ldquo;heeled&rdquo; him. The
recumbent lad was furious. He scrambled to his
feet, using a torrent of strong language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No necessity for that,&rdquo; remarked Rob. The
only answer was another volley of profanity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, take this coat,&rdquo; said Rob, turning to
Tubby, and, slipping out of the garment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to give this fellow a lesson. Next to smoking
cigarettes, the worst habit a boy can get into is
using bad language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is, is it? You puling, Sunday-school
scholar, take that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt crouched, and, suddenly becoming erect,
aimed a terrific blow at Rob&rsquo;s head. But, to his
surprise, his fist encountered thin air. The next
instant, however, something struck him under the
chin that felt like a battering-ram. Hunt shook
his head and staggered a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had enough?&rdquo; inquired Rob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to
quit if you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt&rsquo;s answer was a perfect bellow of anger.
In the city he had been the bully of his neighborhood.
He had expected to occupy the same desirable
position at Hampton, but, alas for him,
he had been speedily disillusioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>He charged at Rob, and this time managed to
get in a powerful blow on the ribs of the Eagle
Patrol leader. It made Rob gasp for an instant,
but before Hunt could launch another, Rob countered,
ducked, and, rising suddenly under Hunt&rsquo;s
guard, like a steel-springed Jack-in-the-box, he
gave the fellow a swift lesson in boxing. Hunt
was staggering about, but still vicious and unconquered,
when two figures suddenly crept through
the hedge and landed in the road. They were
both rough-looking youths, and as well as could
be seen in the gloom, were about the same age, or
possibly a little older, than any of the lads in the
road.</p>
<p>But the sight of them brought a shout to Rob&rsquo;s
lips. His exclamation of astonishment was
speedily echoed by Merritt and Tubby Hopkins.</p>
<p>In the gathering gloom he had recognized the
newcomers as Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender.
They, on their part, were equally quick in recalling
the boys of the Eagle Patrol. Jack Curtiss
had a thick stick, a sort of club, in his hand. He
raised it threateningly, and made at Rob with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pretending virtuous
indignation, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re at your old tricks of
bullying and plug-uglying again, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PAUL PERKINS, MOTOR SCOOTER.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep out of this, Jack Curtiss,&rdquo;
warned Rob, not at all perturbed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
anything to do with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t! I suppose you didn&rsquo;t have me
sent to pris&mdash;I mean to a friend&rsquo;s for a visit, and
you didn&rsquo;t try to fix Bill Bender? I&rsquo;ve got some
scores against you, Rob Blake, and I&rsquo;m going to
pay them out, right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tirade proved as astonishing to Hunt and
his companions as it did to our boys. Rob and
his friends had supposed that Curtiss and Bender
were still in prison in the West for the part
they had played in the cattle rustling raids. They
did not know that influence had been brought to
bear in their favor, and on account of their youth
the lads had been released. Both had arrived in
the village the day before, getting off the train at
a distant station and driving to their homes unnoticed.
That afternoon they had been taking a
stroll in the woods, killing small animals and
stoning birds. They were on their way home,
when the noise of the encounter in the road attracted
their attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>But somehow, although Jack Curtiss&rsquo;s arm was
raised, it did not fall. Instead, he suddenly
thought better of the matter, and retreated, mumbling
angrily. Perhaps it had occurred to him
that he was not in good odor in the village anyway,
and to become mixed up in a fight or attack
on the boys might result in his once again being
compelled to leave the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack,&rdquo; put in Bill Bender; &ldquo;no use
mixing up in this thing. I hope that Rob Blake
gets the thrashing he deserves, though, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he won&rsquo;t get it this time,&rdquo; laughed
Tubby, pointing to Hunt, who, the first shock of
astonishment at the interruption over, sat nursing
his face on the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, don&rsquo;t you interfere,&rdquo; said Lem Lonsdale,
stepping forward threateningly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! You want to fight, too?&rdquo; demanded
the fat boy, rolling up his sleeves pugnaciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll settle with you some other time,&rdquo; responded
Lonsdale, with all the dignity he could
command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows. Let&rsquo;s be getting on home,&rdquo;
exclaimed Rob, who had no wish to prolong the
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; chimed in Merritt. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like the company around here very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt still sat on the bank, nursing his jaw,
and Rob began to be afraid that he had hit harder
than he had intended. He approached the other
with his hand outstretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Hunt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you brought it
on yourself, old scout. See here, let&rsquo;s you and
I get together and try to cement friendship between
the Hawks and the Eagles. It isn&rsquo;t the
scout game to sulk and have ructions. Shake
hands, won&rsquo;t you, and we&rsquo;ll call it off and run
the two patrols in harmony.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Hunt heard him to the end with sullen apathy.
No change of expression crossed his face. As
Rob concluded, however, he looked up and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess that&rsquo;s about all. Except
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except nothing!&rdquo; almost screamed Hunt,
springing to his feet, &ldquo;I hate you, Rob Blake.
Ever since you got back from that fool western
trip of yours, you&rsquo;ve tried to run the village. You
won&rsquo;t do it, see? Don&rsquo;t talk friendship to me. I&rsquo;ll
fight you to the last ditch, you see if I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s the way you feel about it,&rdquo; said
Rob, with a slight sigh, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing I can
do. But it isn&rsquo;t right that two patrols of Boy
Scouts should be at loggerheads, just because of
your envious temper&mdash;for that&rsquo;s all it amounts
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt, white-faced and trembling, was about to
make another spring at Rob, when Dale caught
him and held him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a chump, Freeman,&rdquo; he said in a low
voice, &ldquo;Rob Blake is more than your match. Let
him go. There are other ways to get at him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Rob and his chums did not hear this last remark,
and bidding the others &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; a
politeness which was not responded to, they continued
on their way, leaving behind them three astonished
and angry lads, and the two youths who
already had shown in numerous ways that they
wished all the harm possible to the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender got
out of their trouble in Arizona?&rdquo; mused Merritt,
as they hastened along through the fast-gathering
gloom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; responded Tubby, and neither
could Rob furnish any explanation. It was not
until they entered the village that they learned
the true reason of the unscrupulous youths&rsquo; presence
in Hampton. The little place was a-buzz
with it, and various plans of protest were talked
over. But, as is the case in most small towns in
a matter of that kind, no one was willing to &ldquo;bell
the cat,&rdquo; namely, notify Jack&rsquo;s and Bill&rsquo;s parents
that the boys were not wanted. So they remained
in town, and their presence soon became unremarked.
In the meantime, however, an alliance
had been formed between Freeman Hunt and his
particular friends and Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender,
which boded ill for our lads. To the warnings
of their boy friends, however, Rob, Merritt
and Tubby only rejoined with laughter. They
felt that they had nothing to fear from such a
company, in which, as the sequel will show, they
were very much mistaken.</p>
<p>On Rob&rsquo;s arrival at home that night, he hastened
to his room to remove all traces of his encounter.
Washed and dressed, he was about to
descend to the library, when, to his astonishment,
he heard a strange voice conversing with his
father in that room. Yet there was something
familiar in the tones, too. Where had he heard
it before? At last Rob heard &ldquo;Good-nights&rdquo; exchanged
between his father and the stranger,
and soon after came the swift &ldquo;chug-chug&rdquo; of an
auto, which, apparently, had been driven around
the house, for the boy had not noticed it when
he returned home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was your visitor, father?&rdquo; inquired Rob,
as he sat down to dinner that evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a Lieutenant Duvall, of the regular
army,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blake broke off abruptly, for Rob had
given a cry of astonishment as he heard the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know him? I should say so. Why, he&rsquo;s the
fellow who led those troops into the Moqui Valley.
Don&rsquo;t you remember, when they were giving
the snake dance, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rob, I cannot bear to hear about such
things!&rdquo; exclaimed his mother. &ldquo;You might have
been killed by those Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they would have liked to do something
like that,&rdquo; responded Rob, with a laugh,
&ldquo;but it all ended happily, mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as I said, he was the officer who led
the cavalry to our rescue. What can he be doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about Lieutenant Duvall?&rdquo; demanded
his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know. He was very reticent about his
business. He came to me with a letter of introduction.
You know, he has rented the old De
Regny place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;What, the old haunted villa north of here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Blake. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t imagine why he wants it, but, beyond saying
that he was here on official business, connected
with aeronautical experiments, he would
not give me any inkling of the object of his occupancy
of the place. His errand to me was to
open an account in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is odd,&rdquo; mused Rob. &ldquo;The De Regny place
hasn&rsquo;t been occupied for many years, has it,
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since Napoleon was sent to St. Helena by
the British, my boy. General de Regny, who
built the place, was one of the great French leader&rsquo;s
most devoted marshals. After Waterloo, he
came over here, apparently at Napoleon&rsquo;s own behest,
and built this house on the seashore. They
say that secret passages run into the grounds
from the beach. If this is so, the entrances to
them have never been found.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want secret passages for?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Blake, to whom the story was comparatively
new. Rob had already heard it in various forms
from a dozen sources about the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, it is always supposed that there
was a plan on foot to rescue Napoleon from St.
Helena,&rdquo; explained Mr. Blake. &ldquo;In that case, the
supposition is, he would have made direct for the
Long Island coast, and have been landed in the
De Regny home by means of the secret passage
from the beach. Of course, you recall the square,
glass-sided watch-tower on the summit of the
house. That, I imagine, was placed there so that
the sea could be constantly scanned for a trace
of the approaching vessel bearing the rescued emperor.
But, of course, he never came, and in time
De Regny died, and the property went to some
heirs of his in Virginia. What the government
or Lieutenant Duvall can want with it, is beyond
my comprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner Rob lost no time in slipping off to
find Merritt and Tubby Hopkins. By telephoning,
he found out that they had both gone to
the home of Paul Perkins, who will be recalled
as the winner of the model aeroplane contest described
in the first volume of this series, and the
aeronautical enthusiast of the Eagle Patrol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Thither, accordingly, Rob hastened to find his
friends and communicate the surprising news
concerning the old De Regny place. Paul&rsquo;s
mother informed him that he would find the boys
in the old wagon house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the wagon house?&rdquo; exclaimed Rob in some
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Perkins. &ldquo;Paul has some
sort of contrivance out there. Whether it&rsquo;s to
fly, crawl or walk, I don&rsquo;t know. I only hope he
won&rsquo;t break his neck or spile his pants with it,
like he did the last time he flitted on wings, and
tried to flop from ther wagon house roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he break his neck, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; inquired Rob,
with a perfectly serious countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he did not,&rdquo; innocently rejoined Mrs. Perkins,
&ldquo;but he tore his pants suthin&rsquo; awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, as Rob approached the wagon
house, he could see light streaming from the
wide chinks of the tumble-down place, and could
catch the sound of boyish voices within.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that, Paul?&rdquo; he heard Merritt&rsquo;s
voice inquiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the propeller,&rdquo; rejoined Paul, with a
quiver of pride in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, where do you keep the grub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Tubby,&rdquo; thought Rob, with a
smile. Hastening forward, he rapped at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul, as Rob, at the
same instant, uttered the patrol cry in a peculiar,
low tone.</p>
<p>Rob pushed open the door, and saw before
him, illuminated by the light of a stable lantern,
the most peculiar looking piece of machinery he
had ever set eyes on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he gasped in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a motor-scooter,&rdquo; declared Paul, with the
inventor&rsquo;s pride vibrating in his voice. He held
the lamp aloft so that its radiance streamed on a
glittering, bewildering mass of bars, levers, connecting
rods and brace wires.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BOY WHO MADE THE WHEELS GO ROUND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;A motor-scooter!&rdquo; echoed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Rob, and she&rsquo;s a Jim Dandy,
too!&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll eat up space,&rdquo; volunteered Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always on the eating tack,&rdquo; laughed Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than being full of them,&rdquo; remarked the
fat boy, dreamily gazing up into the black shadows
of the wagon shed roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Paul,&rdquo; asked Rob interestedly, &ldquo;would
you mind telling me what is a motor-scooter. It
looks fine,&rdquo; he added encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motor-scooter,&rdquo; exclaimed Paul, &ldquo;is a sled
driven by an auto engine and propelled by an
aeroplane propeller over the frozen surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds fine,&rdquo; chuckled Merritt; &ldquo;bet you
cribbed it out of a book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Paul Perkins, paying no attention, went on to
explain to Rob the points of the strange craft.
He had constructed it ingeniously from parts of
an old, broken-down auto left behind by a summer
resident. The engine part of the affair
rested on a framework of two-by-four timbers,
and to the flywheel of the motor had been fitted
a pulley connected with a shaft mounted above it,
on one end of which was affixed a six-foot aeroplane
propeller.</p>
<p>Behind the engine came a seat for the driver,
and another beside it for a passenger. Gasoline
was carried in a ten-gallon tank placed forward
of, and above the motor, while the cooling was
effected by means of a fan geared to the forward
part of the machinery. Below the framework
came the runners on which the odd craft was
expected to glide over the ice. These were
formed of old wagon timbers, along which strips
of iron, constructed from barrel binders, had
been nailed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Such was Paul Perkins&rsquo; wonderful motor-scooter.
Rob, after an inspection of the clever
way in which it was put together, could not help
admiring the ingenuity of the young constructor.
He knew that Paul was not a rich boy, and that
it must have cost him a lot of time and labor to
carry out his idea without funds to buy expensive
tools or appliances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merritt&rsquo;s father let me use the forge at
night,&rdquo; explained Paul, &ldquo;and in that way Merritt
came to be the first to know about it. I told
him during last summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he kept your secret, too,&rdquo; laughed Rob.
&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell any one else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid that it mightn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, will it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul clambered into the driver&rsquo;s seat and threw
in a small switch. Then he turned on the gasoline
and adjusted the carburetor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he turned a crank which he had
geared to a toothed wheel on the shaft. The engine
turned over once or twice, and only a sort
of low sigh resulted. Suddenly there came a
sharp sound, like twin explosions.</p>
<p><i>Chug-chug!</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray, she&rsquo;s off!&rdquo; shouted Tubby.</p>
<p>Faster and faster the engine began to revolve,
the smoke from its exhausts filling the place with
smothering vapor. Through the blue haze, they
could see the aeroplane propeller threshing round
at terrific speed. The frame of the novel craft
quivered, as if anxious to move off. But, of
course, it could not. The motor-scooter was built
for traveling only upon the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever come to think of it?&rdquo; asked
Rob, as Paul shut off the engine and climbed out
of his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was last winter,&rdquo; explained Paul,
&ldquo;you remember the inlet was frozen, and we had
iceboat races on it? Well, I was watching them,
and thinking why it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to make
an ice motor-boat. First off, I couldn&rsquo;t see how
to do it. I figured around, however, and at last
I thought out a way. But I didn&rsquo;t have money
enough to buy a motor, so I gave up the idea.
Then Higgins&rsquo; auto blew up and took fire. He
was disgusted, and when I offered him a small
price for the engine he was delighted. He
wouldn&rsquo;t take anything for it, in fact. He figured
that the fire had spoiled it. So it had, pretty
well, but I fixed it up&mdash;and&mdash;well, there she is,
and what do you think of her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think?&rdquo; exclaimed Rob. &ldquo;I think she is a
Jim Dandy, just as Merritt said. But, Paul, will
she run on the ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why not. The propeller has tremendous
driving power. I wish it would hurry
up and freeze, I&rsquo;m dying to try her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you are. It will be a long time yet to
frost, though. In the meantime, what do you say
to taking a little trip out to-morrow afternoon to
the old De Regny place? It will make a good
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you want to go out there
for?&rdquo; asked Tubby in a surprised tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a reason,&rdquo; rejoined Rob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
about it to-morrow. Do you fellows want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but you&rsquo;re mighty mysterious about
it,&rdquo; grumbled Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Maybe he&rsquo;s found a corned beef
mine!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby in a low, cautious voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;A corned beef mine? Why, I never heard of
such a thing,&rdquo; exclaimed Paul seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didst not, little one?&rdquo; chirped Tubby. &ldquo;My
uncle found one in northern Montana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In northern Montana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; went on Tubby, winking at the others,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s an interesting thing to a fellow like you,
Paul, who is fond of scientific research and&mdash;and
all that sort of thing. Shall I tell you how it occurred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; begged Paul, sitting down on
the edge of his invention and composing himself
comfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Tubby, with the air of one who
has deliberated long and seriously over a matter,
&ldquo;it was this way. One fall my uncle, who had
been mining all summer, figured it was about
time to get out of those northern Montana mountains.
He decided, though, before he left, to put
in the biggest blast ever heard of, so that when
he came back in the spring he could have plenty
of rock to work. In due course, he set the blast
off, and discovered, to his astonishment, that the
explosion had uncovered a regular cliff of reddish-brown
substance, interveined with what
looked like the finest jelly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do tell you. Well, uncle was considerably
puzzled. He had never struck anything like
that before. All at once, glancing down, he saw
his dog was advancing to the cliff. Presently,
the creature seized a fragment that had been
blasted to some distance, and began devouring it.
Imagine my uncle&rsquo;s astonishment to find that the
cliff seemingly was edible. He investigated, and
found that his blast had miraculously uncovered
a deposit of unknown extent of the very finest
kind of corned beef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he find a ketchup well or a mustard
spring close by?&rdquo; asked Merritt seriously.</p>
<p>Tubby shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; uncle was a very truthful man. If he
had found anything like that, he&rsquo;d have mentioned
it. But he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the explanation,&rdquo; urged the scientific-minded
Paul, &ldquo;how did he ever account for it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, an inquiry showed that years before
there had been an earthquake there, and a band
of cattle had been swallowed up, and it so happened
that they were immersed in a salt mine.
Thus, a very fine stratum of corned beef was
formed, which only awaited my uncle&rsquo;s coming to
be given to a grateful public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that this all happened to your uncle?&rdquo;
asked Paul somewhat suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure, to my uncle in Montana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really happened to him?&rdquo; insisted Paul, who
had detected a suspicious quiver on Tubby&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. It happened to him just before
he fell out of bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout of laughter went up then, echoing and
ringing among the rafters. Paul good-naturedly
joined in it, though the merriment was at his own
expense, but his laughter was suddenly checked.
There was a small window in one side of the
place, and, peering through this aperture, Paul
had just detected a face. It was a countenance
that was familiar to him, and seemed to be taking
the utmost interest in the details of his invention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Paul?&rdquo; asked Rob, checking
his mirth, as he saw the younger lad&rsquo;s eyes
fixed upon the window-pane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I saw a face there, an instant ago,&rdquo; stuttered
Paul. &ldquo;It was looking in on us, but it instantly
vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A face! Gee, whiz! who could it have been?&rdquo;
exclaimed Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; rejoined Paul, &ldquo;but I kind of
thought I recognized it for the minute that I
saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freeman Hunt, that fellow who used to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the others had shot out of the barn at top
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give that fellow a lesson if I catch him
prowling around here,&rdquo; growled Merritt.</p>
<p>But, although they searched about the place
thoroughly, they could find no trace of the intruder.
When they got back to the shed, they
found Paul putting up an old sack over the window
through which the face had peered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take any chances with this
machine,&rdquo; the lad said earnestly, &ldquo;and I want you
fellows to promise not to tell any one about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; they readily agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it patented yet?&rdquo; inquired Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Paul. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put the matter in
the hands of a lawyer in Washington, a friend of
my dead father. I guess he&rsquo;ll put it through. I
want to sell it and pay off the mortgage on the
house; but, in the meantime, I don&rsquo;t want any one
to know its details whom I can&rsquo;t trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the secret&rsquo;s safe with us, Paul,&rdquo; Rob
assured him, as they parted for the night, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t tell too many people about it. That&rsquo;s a
valuable invention, to my mind, and you want to
guard it closely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Paul promised, but he did not tell Rob
that earlier in the week he had confided his great
secret to Freeman Hunt. That worthy had heard
something of a mysterious machine the lad was
constructing, and took occasion to find out what
it was. By flattering the unsuspecting boy,
and telling him what marvelous things he had
heard of him, Freeman soon put himself in possession
of the details of the machine&rsquo;s construction,
and of the things Paul expected to accomplish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; Hunt had commented to himself
that evening; &ldquo;maybe we can make some
thing out of that kid&rsquo;s information. I&rsquo;ll tell my
dad about it. He&rsquo;s slick as paint, dad is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TWO MYSTERIOUS MEN.</span></h2>
<p>The next afternoon the four lads left the village
shortly after lunch, and struck out along the
sandy road leading in the direction of the De
Regny place. It was warm, and, walking on the
heavy, sandy road proved oppressive. In fact,
before they had traversed two miles of the distance,
Tubby was begging for a drink of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with water?&rdquo; scoffed Merritt.
&ldquo;Doctors say that it makes fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; retorted Tubby. &ldquo;I want a
drink, and I&rsquo;m going to have it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dig in the road for it, I suppose, or get it
out of the sea yonder,&rdquo; laughed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, Mister Smart Alec; I&rsquo;m going to
get it at that house back there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The stout lad indicated a rather tumble-down
dwelling, situated in the midst of a ragged orchard,
which was set back some distance from
the road. It had once been the home of a fisherman,
but had been long deserted. Tubby knew,
however, there was a well on the place, which
yielded clear, cold water. Without another word
to his companions, he struck off across the uneven
ground toward the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I could stand a drink,&rdquo; said Merritt
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Rob, and the two struck
off after their rotund comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty, too,&rdquo; said Paul.</p>
<p>Close to the house, dense clumps of lilacs had
grown up, straggling in every direction, and
forming a deep, impenetrable screen. As the
boys came up to the place, they were startled to
hear, from within the hut, the sound of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the place was deserted,&rdquo; gasped
Merritt, using a low tone, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; chimed in Tubby. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out
of here. Maybe they&rsquo;re tramps, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly likely,&rdquo; whispered Rob, parting the
bushes ever so little and peering through. The
other two each made a similar observation place
for himself. Through this leafy screen they
could see the interior of the front room of the hut
plainly. To their astonishment, a few rough
pieces of furniture stood within, and, at a battered
table, two men were seated, talking earnestly.
One of them was a big, broad-shouldered fellow,
with a ruddy face and shifty blue eyes. The
other was a small, dapper man, dressed nattily,
almost fastidiously. The back of this latter fellow
had been partly turned when the lads came
in, but as he faced restlessly about in his chair,
the boys could not suppress a start of astonishment.</p>
<p>The man was a Japanese!</p>
<p>More surprising still, the fellow with him
could now be seen to be garbed in the uniform
of a United States regular.</p>
<p>Fascinated, with round eyes and attentive ears,
the boys bent forward on tip-toe to hear the conversation
that was going on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;So Duvall suspects nothing,&rdquo; the Japanese
said in perfect English, evidently continuing a
conversation, the first part of which they had
missed.</p>
<p>The soldier laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he. I&rsquo;ve managed to get several drawings
besides the ones I have already brought you.
In about a week&rsquo;s time my work will be finished,
and then I&rsquo;ll skip. You are sure your government
will have that appointment for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely certain, Honorable Dugan. Nippon
is not ungrateful for any services that may
have been done her, and you will reap your reward.
But when is the trial flight to be made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the equalizer is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that will be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time this coming week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not been able to get plans of the
equalizer yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; as I told you, I have failed so far. Lieutenant
Duvall will not let them out of his hands.
But I&rsquo;ll get them, if I have to knock him down
and take them from him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; smiled the Jap. &ldquo;I could
wish you were acquainted with jiu-jitsu, to make
your task more easy. Above all things, I must
have the working plans of the equalizer. The
rest does not matter so much, but to equip our
aerial fleet we must have that device.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s the invention of Duvall himself,
and for that reason he guards it pretty close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally. However, we shall be too clever
for him. You don&rsquo;t think any one suspects my
presence here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; Dugan assured his yellow
skinned companion. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you come in by
night and make straight for this place? You
couldn&rsquo;t have a better hiding-place. No one ever
comes here, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Cra-c-k!</i></p>
<p>A board, upon which Tubby had unthinkingly
stood, so as to obtain a better view, gave way
under the heavy youth&rsquo;s weight at this interesting
point. With a gasp of dismay, Tubby
clutched at the lilacs to save himself from falling,
thereby creating even more noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; roared Dugan, springing to
his feet. The boys caught the glint of a revolver,
as he shot erect. Like a small and venomous
snake, the Jap, too, was up like a flash. But
they were neither of them quick enough to catch
a glimpse of the scouts, as they dashed off into a
patch of woods lying to the left, into the shadows
of which they had dived, wriggling along on
their stomachs, before either Dugan or the Jap
had recovered from their start.</p>
<p>From their cover, the boys could see the pair
emerge from the house and search about it thoroughly,
without, of course, finding a trace of anything
unusual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it must have been a rabbit or something,&rdquo;
they could hear Dugan say, after a prolonged
search that showed no indication of human
surveillance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Honorable rabbit gave me a big
jump,&rdquo; they heard the Jap rejoin.</p>
<p>The two went back into the house, no doubt to
continue their deliberations, while the boys, making
a detour through the woods, once more
emerged on the main road, with Tubby&rsquo;s thirst
still unsatisfied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you suppose was the meaning
of that confab?&rdquo; asked Merritt, as they trudged
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me like treachery of some sort,&rdquo;
rejoined Rob. &ldquo;Those Japs have been busy in
Mexico during the insurrection. You know, they
wanted to get a coaling base there. They certainly
are not friends of Uncle Sam&rsquo;s, however
much they pretend to be, and when you see one
of our soldiers in such a consultation with one of
them, it looks bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Merritt. &ldquo;But what
could they have been talking about? Of course,
you told us about Lieutenant Duvall having leased
the De Regny place for some mysterious government
work. Evidently that man Dugan is there
with him, and perhaps several more soldiers. But
what do you suppose they are doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was one reason why I proposed this
walk this afternoon,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;Maybe we can
find out something. But I think from what Dugan
said it&rsquo;s pretty plain what the government
is doing at the De Regny place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it is, Rob?&rdquo; asked Tubby
interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Testing out some sort of an airship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Didn&rsquo;t you hear the Jap speak
of a Japanese aerial fleet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he did!&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt. &ldquo;And now I
come to think of it, I remember I read some time
ago that Lieutenant Duvall had invented a
stability device for aeroplanes. At the time,
though, I didn&rsquo;t connect it with <i>our lieutenant</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve got to do is to find the lieutenant
and tell him about what we overheard,&rdquo; said
Rob decidedly. &ldquo;Those fellows may succeed in
their schemes, otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby, with a shudder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
hate to have had that fellow Dugan grab hold of
me. He&rsquo;s an ugly-looking customer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; agreed Rob, &ldquo;but we can&rsquo;t help that.
Our duty is clear. Why, if the Japs ever got hold
of a practicable invention like that, they could
send an aerial fleet across the border and demoralize
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Always supposing it is a practicable invention,&rdquo;
put in the practical Paul Perkins quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the impetuous Rob hastened to
agree.</p>
<p>Talking thus, they neared the De Regny place,
which deserves some description, as being, both
by tradition and appearance, one of the most remarkable
places along the Long Island shores.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HOW A SECRET PASSAGE WAS USED.</span></h2>
<p>The house was a mouldering mansion of
wood, three stories in height, and once a truly
imposing specimen of the architecture of the
period in which it was erected. Time and neglect,
however, had done their work, and it was
now dark, unpainted, and forbidding looking, set
back, as it was, in a fenced park of several acres
in extent. A clump of dark hemlocks surrounded
the house, adding to the gloomy note of its unpainted
walls, broken shutters and shattered windows,
while in the neglected grounds weeds and
trailing, unkempt vines ran riot everywhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Only to seaward was the place unencumbered
by this wild, disordered tangle. In that direction
there lay a broad, brick-floored terrace, of
immense dimensions, upon which, tradition had
it, Marshal De Regny used to strut with a telescope,
ever and anon looking seaward for a
sight of the expected vessel bearing the rescued
captive from St. Helena.</p>
<p>This terrace, the boys were astonished to see,
had been recently swept and repaired, offering
a broad, smooth floor of considerable extent. At
one end, too, stood a brand-new shed, painted
green, and quite large. In front, and opening on
the terrace, this shed had large double doors.
What it housed could hardly be guessed from
the exterior. The few fishermen who visited this
isolated part of the beach concluded that the
green shed must be a sort of boathouse.</p>
<p>The boys, however, basing their conclusions on
the conversation they had overheard a short
time before, decided that the airship, or aeroplane,
or whatever kind of aerial craft it was,
with which experiments were being conducted,
must be housed within this shed.</p>
<p>Suddenly they saw a slender, erect figure, clad
in the uniform of an officer of the United States
Army, crossing the rough lawn lying between
the house and the bricked terrace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lieutenant Duvall!&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, hastening
forward, followed by the others. The
officer presently spied the intruders, and stopped
short, with an angry expression on his countenance
as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys must keep off here!&rdquo; he ordered,
coming toward them. &ldquo;This is now government
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get off it in just five minutes,&rdquo; answered
Rob, somewhat abashed at this reception, &ldquo;but
in the meantime I&rsquo;ve something to tell you of
great importance. It hasn&rsquo;t to do with the Moquis,
either,&rdquo; he added mischievously.</p>
<p>At these words, a great light seemed to break
over the officer. In the nattily-uniformed boys
before him, it was no wonder he had not sooner
recognized the lads he had last seen in tattered,
worn, cowboy rig-outs, stained with powder, and
worn by a hard chase across the mountains to
the Moqui valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his manner changing,
and both hands extended in a cordial way, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
the young broncho busters! Hull-lo, boys! I&rsquo;m
glad to see you again. But what are you doing
in this part of the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We happen to live here,&rdquo; rejoined Rob demurely,
after the first greetings had been exchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. You did tell me, I remember now,
that you lived here. That must have been your
father I saw last night. Very forgetful of me,
but I&rsquo;ve had so much on my mind lately that I&rsquo;ve
slipped up on a lot of things I should have carried
a recollection of. We&rsquo;re carrying out some big
experiments here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which brings us to what we accidentally
overheard on our way out here,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob.
&ldquo;Is there a man named Dugan detailed to duty
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dugan? Yes&mdash;a most capable man&mdash;invaluable
to me. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer was frankly astonished, and showed
his bewilderment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>As may be imagined, his astonishment not only
increased, but became mingled with anger, as
Rob launched out into a full and detailed account
of all they had overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel,&rdquo; muttered the officer, gritting
his teeth, &ldquo;and to think that I have regarded him
as my most trusted assistant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t know the secret of your equalizer,&rdquo;
ventured Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Thank goodness, he does not, but,&rdquo; the
officer&rsquo;s face grew troubled, &ldquo;I wish I had the
plans in a safe place. Somehow, since you have
told me all this, I can only regard everybody
about me as a traitor. If only I had left the plans
with your father to be placed in the safe deposit
vault in his bank, my mind would be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can work out your ideas without
the plans?&rdquo; asked Rob, in some astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, when an inventor has dreamed, and
thought and pondered over an idea for many
long days and sleepless nights, it is photographed
on his brain, and he can never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have an idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Rob. &ldquo;Let
me take the plans back with me to town. I can
hand them over to my father, and he can place
them in a vault in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; exclaimed the young officer.
&ldquo;I know I can trust you, Blake, and you won&rsquo;t
mind if I give them to you in a sealed envelope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; rejoined Rob. He flushed a bit,
though, as he spoke, although the words came
readily enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained the officer, who had noticed
the flush, &ldquo;I almost dread to let even you
have the plans. I cannot bear to let them out of
my sight. This Jap&mdash;I have a suspicion who he
is&mdash;is not the only one who is after them for
his government. Aerial equipment has now become
an important adjunct of every navy and
army. In Washington, two attempts were made
to get them from me, but in this lonely place I
thought I was safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;At least in my father&rsquo;s bank they will be secure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began Rob, when he broke off short,
and turned swiftly. His keen ear had detected
a slight rustling in a clump of bushes behind him.
As he communicated his suspicion that some one
might have been concealed there, they all sprang
forward, surrounding the clump, but there was
no sign of a concealed listener, and, satisfied that
everything was well, they followed the young officer
toward the house. Their conductor narrated,
as they went, such details of the experimental
work as he thought might interest the
lads.</p>
<p>Hardly had they vanished within the gloomy,
deserted mansion, however, before two faces appeared
above the surface of the ground, peering
up from the mouth of one of the concealed passages
which Mr. Blake had mentioned as existing
on the old place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Could the boys have seen those two countenances,
they would have been greatly interested,
for one of them was Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s and the
other was Jack Curtiss&rsquo;s. To explain how they
came to be there, it is necessary to revert for a
moment to an occurrence which took place some
weeks before on a fishing expedition. Driven by
bad weather to shelter in the little cove not far
from the De Regny place, the party, consisting of
Freeman Hunt, Dale Harding and Lem Lonsdale,
had hastily sought a shelter from the pelting rain,
as their boat was an open one. In a low, rocky
cliff, a half-obscured opening showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like there might be a cave in behind
there,&rdquo; Hunt said, and, on his suggestion, they
set to work moving away several big rocks that
encumbered the opening. The place proved to
be a cave, and an ample one, running back to a
great depth, seemingly.</p>
<p>An exploration party had been formed at once,
and, after traversing a narrow passage, running
back underground for some distance, the lads
emerged, to their astonishment, in the clump of
bushes in which Rob had just heard the rustling
sound.</p>
<p>On this particular day, Hunt and Jack Curtiss
had visited the cave alone to explore it more
thoroughly. The branch passages they expected
to find were not there, however, but, threading
the original one, they had emerged into the clump
which thickly screened its opening, in time to
overhear most of the conversation of the Boy
Scouts and the army officer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>As the door of the old house slammed, its
echoes reverberating through the tangled, overgrown
grounds, Jack Curtiss turned to his companion
with a grin of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the chance we&rsquo;ve been looking for,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, wiping the sweat and dirt from his
forehead,&mdash;for burrowing in long disused passages
is dirty work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean a chance to get even?&rdquo; asked Hunt
in a puzzled tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We can fix that Rob Blake up so that
he&rsquo;ll be in disgrace from this afternoon on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; rejoined Freeman, who,
while he had chosen Jack Curtiss for a companion,
had not a tenth part of the other&rsquo;s evil ingenuity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; was the confident rejoinder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
up to us to find this Jap and this Dugan, or whatever
his name is. If we can do so, we&rsquo;ve got Rob
Blake where we want him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see now!&rdquo; exclaimed Hunt, a light of comprehension
showing in his eyes, &ldquo;but do you
dare&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dare!&rdquo; repeated Jack Curtiss scornfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
dare do anything to get even with Rob Blake,
and,&rdquo; he added prudently, &ldquo;the best of it is, that
there&rsquo;s not a chance of it ever being traced to us.
If we are only lucky enough to find those fellows
they mentioned, they can do the dirty work, and
we have the satisfaction of being even with those
cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are you going to find them?&rdquo; asked
Hunt, still hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one road from that hut to this
place. We&rsquo;ll sneak through the grounds while
they are all in the house, and nail this chap Dugan
in time to put our plan into execution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An instant later, two grimy, dust-covered
forms emerged from the bowels of the earth, as
it seemed, and shoving their way through the
dense clump of bushes, glanced cautiously about
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coast&rsquo;s clear,&rdquo; announced Jack presently.</p>
<p>Together, Rob&rsquo;s old enemy and Freeman Hunt,
now his equally bitter foe, sped across the De
Regny grounds and toward the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You younkers are certain you are telling me
the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dugan, the treacherous private, paused, and,
from his immense height, looked down into the
faces of Jack Curtiss and Freeman Hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As sure as we stand here,&rdquo; Jack assured him,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you how we came to overhear what
was said. If you want those plans, now is your
chance to get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget to beat Rob Blake up good
and proper,&rdquo; chimed in Hunt, who had lost all
prudence in his eagerness to have his grudge
avenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dugan grunted. &ldquo;I guess
if he&rsquo;s the sort of boy you describe him to be, he
won&rsquo;t give them up without a struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;You could break him in two with one hand
tied behind your back,&rdquo; struck in Jack, gazing at
the immense frame and loosely hung, ape-like
arms of Dugan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me, kid,&rdquo; Dugan assured him,
with an ominous grin, &ldquo;and&mdash;hullo, here comes
Hashashi now. That&rsquo;s lucky. I may need him
if there are three of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning in the direction in which the soldier
had spied the newcomer, the lads saw a small,
slightly-built figure approaching them. It was
the Japanese with whom Dugan had been seen
conversing in the hut when the unsuspected listeners
had overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll be going,&rdquo; said Jack Curtiss uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; exclaimed Dugan, clutching him
with a grip of iron, as he spoke. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to
promise me that you don&rsquo;t tell nothing of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Jack assured him; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve promised
you once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I guess you&rsquo;ll keep your word,&rdquo; said the
man, grimly compressing his lips till they formed
a narrow line. &ldquo;If I ever suspect you of telling
a thing about it, I&rsquo;ve got you two ways. In the
first place, I&rsquo;ll reveal your part in the plot, and,
in the second, I&rsquo;m a bad man to have for an
enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dugan drew his low forehead into a dozen
horizontal puckers, as he spoke. With his lowering
brow and ape-like face, he looked indeed, as
he had said, &ldquo;a bad man to have for an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye understand?&rdquo; he grated harshly, glaring
at Jack grimly.</p>
<p>Curtiss, who was as big a coward as he was
a bully and reprobate, felt his knees knock together
under that ferocious gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-y-yes, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, too!&rdquo; hissed Dugan, switching suddenly
on Freeman Hunt, who was looking nervous and
ill at ease. He began to think that perhaps they
had let themselves in for something more serious
than they had bargained for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t breathe a word of it,&rdquo; Hunt hastened
to assure him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; snarled Dugan, more savagely
than ever, &ldquo;now, git!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Without further loss of time, Jack Curtiss and
Freeman Hunt &ldquo;got.&rdquo; To their surprise, as they
turned to hasten off, no sign of the Jap was to
be seen, yet an instant before he had been in the
road, not more than ten yards from them. There
were no hedges at this point, and salt meadows
stretched out to the sea on one side, and stubble-fields,
flat and level, on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth did that Jap go to?&rdquo; asked
Jack in a mystified tone, as they hurried away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; rejoined Freeman, with a trembly
feeling. &ldquo;There was something uncanny
about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I begin to wish we hadn&rsquo;t met those fellows
or had anything to do with them,&rdquo; he burst
out, in a complaining tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go, sniveling like a baby,&rdquo; sneered
Jack Curtiss. &ldquo;Why, a short time ago, you were
only too pleased to have found such an easy way
of getting even on Rob Blake and those other
young whelps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; rejoined Hunt timidly, &ldquo;but&mdash;but I
don&rsquo;t like the look of that fellow Dugan. He
scared me. If he ever suspects us of betraying
him, he&rsquo;ll take a terrible revenge. I wish we
hadn&rsquo;t meddled in the thing at all, I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you make me tired,&rdquo; broke in his companion
angrily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not going to tell about it,
are we? We won&rsquo;t be foolish enough to let on
that we had anything to do with the beating Rob
Blake is bound to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; quavered Hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell it to your grandmother,&rdquo; scoffed Jack.
&ldquo;Come on. Hurry up; we want to get away from
here before the fun begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastening on, they soon were out of sight and
earshot of the spot in which their momentous
colloquy had taken place.</p>
<p>In the meantime, from behind a large rock, not
far from where Dugan was standing, the lithe
form of the Jap suddenly upreared itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! You gave me a scare that time!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dugan, as his ally came into view. &ldquo;How
did you vanish like that, a few minutes ago?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Simple, my dear friend. I simply took advantage
of a large rock by the roadside, and
dodged behind it. There was nothing of Oriental
mystery in it, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; rejoined Dugan, as if only half convinced.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer fellow, Hashashi.
What did you come after me for, anyhow? Not
but what I&rsquo;m mighty glad to see you right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hastened after you to give you some final
instructions I had forgotten,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;But what were you talking to those boys
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something mighty interesting to us both.
Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dugan rapidly related all that Jack had told
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;there is a chance
that they may not come down this road, but, in
any event, we know now where the plans are,
and if the worst comes to the worst&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vaults of country banks are not proof
against Shimose,&rdquo; grinned the Jap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; exclaimed Dugan suddenly. &ldquo;I hear
voices&mdash;boys, too,&rdquo; he went on, after a minute&rsquo;s
listening; &ldquo;get behind that rock yonder. I&rsquo;ll
stop them and ask the time of day or something,
and you make your appearance when you think
you are needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my honorable comrade,&rdquo; chuckled
the Jap, sliding like a gray-suited shadow toward
the rock, and vanishing from view behind it.</p>
<p>On came the three unsuspecting boys, chatting
and laughing, and little dreaming of what lay in
store for them round the turn of the road. Dugan,
an evil expression on his countenance, drew
back a little, and then, as they drew closer, started
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got the time, young fellow?&rdquo; he asked in a
natural, easy tone, as the three lads came up to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the man we saw in the hut!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tubby, in a rather affrighted tone, but so low
that Dugan did not hear him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can&rsquo;t possibly know what we have
been doing,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, in an equally cautious
voice. Thinking it best not to give the man even
a slight excuse for suspicion, he drew out his
watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just three-thirty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Dugan, who all this time had
been carefully sizing up the three lads. Rob he
recognized by description as being the one who
was likely to carry the plans of the equalizer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; he remarked to himself. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
three husky youngsters for fair. Glad I&rsquo;ve got
a revolver, or I might get the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were starting on again when Dugan
stepped back a pace or two and spread his immense
bulk across their path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
something to say to you. You&rsquo;ve been calling on
Lieutenant Duvall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been for a walk,&rdquo; rejoined Rob
boldly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who this Lieutenant Duvall
is you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, eh, you young mucker?&rdquo; Dugan
had decided that his best chance lay in scaring
the three lads. &ldquo;Well, I do. Don&rsquo;t try to lie
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>He contorted his face in hideous fashion.
This was a trick he had found very successful in
intimidating other persons he wished to bully or
oppress. But in the three boys before him, as
we know, Dugan was up against boys out of the
ordinary run. Instead of being impressed, Rob
simply took a step forward, turning to his chums
and saying in a natural, unshaken voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, come on, fellows,&rdquo; sneered the other.
&ldquo;Not so fast, my young buckos. I want a word
with you. You&rsquo;ve got some plans in your pockets.
Are you going to give them up peaceably, or
do you want a taste of Bill Dugan&rsquo;s fists?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob could not repress a start, not of fear, but
of astonishment, as the fellow spoke.</p>
<p>How could he know anything about the plans
he was carrying to the safe deposit vaults?</p>
<p>Dugan misinterpreted his hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on now,&rdquo; he grated, coming closer, with
an ugly leer on his face; &ldquo;fork over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke his hand crept back toward his
hip. He might have to use his revolver. These
boys were proving more obstinate than he had
imagined. To his amazement, no trace of fear
or alarm appeared on their faces for all his blustering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob boldly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know who you are and I don&rsquo;t think I want to
better the acquaintance. I do know this, however,
that you wear the uniform of a United
States soldier. Let us pass at once, and stop this
nonsense, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a bellow of rage, Bill Dugan leaped forward.
At the same instant he aimed a powerful
blow at Rob&rsquo;s head. The lad could hear the ponderous
fist whistle as it cut through the air. But
somehow, when the blow landed&mdash;or reached the
point where it should have landed&mdash;Rob wasn&rsquo;t
there. The boy had nimbly sidestepped.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="709" />
<p class="caption">With a bellow of rage Bill Dugan leaped forward.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do you no good,&rdquo; bellowed Dugan,
assuming furious rage, both to impress the
boys and to conceal his astonishment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
you where I want you. Are you going to give
up them plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The reply came swift as a bullet. Rob realized
that in some way the rascal before him knew
that the precious designs were in his possession.
He determined that they would not leave his person
without a struggle. Somehow he felt that
the three of them, all clean-lived, healthy, muscular
boys, should prove a match for the hulking,
bloated, blustering brute before him. He was
totally unprepared for the fellow&rsquo;s next move,
however. With a gliding motion of one hand, so
swift as to be almost imperceptible, Dugan suddenly
produced a gun. At the same instant he
gave a shrill whistle, and from behind his rock
the serpentine form of the Jap appeared. His almond
shaped eyes glittered balefully as he took
in the scene before him.</p>
<p>Dugan took quick advantage of the temporary
distraction of the lad&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>With an agility which would hardly have been
expected from his huge proportions, he suddenly
sprang forward. Rob, totally unprepared as he
was for such a move, could not defend himself.
Down he toppled into the dust, before the savage
onslaught of the giant Dugan&rsquo;s great form
falling on top of him and pinning the lad securely
to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WHEREIN CAPTAIN HUDGINS&rsquo; BEES SWARM.</span></h2>
<p>As Rob and the soldier sprawled in the road
&ldquo;hugger-mugger,&rdquo; Merritt darted forward. He
succeeded in seizing Dugan&rsquo;s gnarled fist just as
it was about to come crashing down in the boy&rsquo;s
face, but as his fingers closed upon Dugan&rsquo;s arm
a convulsive pain shot through the corporal of
the Eagles. Switching round he saw, bending
over him, the grinning face of the Jap. The Oriental
had merely pressed upon some nervous center
of Merritt&rsquo;s being, and had for a second paralyzed
all effort. It was the lad&rsquo;s first introduction
to jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; yelled Merritt, in spite of himself.</p>
<p>The next instant his exclamation was echoed
by the Jap. Tubby&rsquo;s rotund form had come hurtling
upon the Oriental like a thunderbolt, bearing
him to the ground. Temporarily his jiu-jitsu
tricks were at a discount.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>But all this did not materially aid Rob, who
felt his strength fast ebbing under ineffectual
attempts to throw off the mighty grip of the massive
Dugan. The giant encircled the lad&rsquo;s windpipe
with his rough fingers and squeezed till Rob
grew purple in the face. In the meantime, the
other lads had their hands full with the Jap, who
had again exercised his cunning, and by a simple
pressure upon a spot near Tubby&rsquo;s heart had
rendered that youth inactive for some moments.</p>
<p>Dugan&rsquo;s great paws were sliding under Rob&rsquo;s
jacket to search his inside pockets, when a voice,
suddenly hailing them, caused both attacked and
attackers to look up. So engrossed had they been
in defense and aggression that not one of them
had noticed the approach of a stout, thick-set
man, in clothes that somehow suggested a sailor.
The newcomer&rsquo;s hair was iron gray and a tuft of
the same colored growth adorned his square chin.
Under his arm he carried a large box of some
kind, carefully covered with newspapers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>For a second he stood petrified with astonishment
at the scene upon which he had so unexpectedly
come. The next instant his blue eyes
snapped steelily, and with a roar he dashed toward
the combatants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avast there!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;Lay aft, you lubbers!
Boy Scouts, ahoy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Hudgins!&rdquo; shouted Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, it&rsquo;s the captain!&rdquo; bawled the valiant ex-tar,
leaping forward and dealing Dugan a terrific
blow with his free arm. With the other he
kept tight hold of his big box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You interfering old lummox!&rdquo; bawled Dugan,
springing erect, with a roar of fury. &ldquo;Keep
out of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; bellowed the captain, just
as loudly. &ldquo;Lay aft, you military pirate, or the
navy&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to wipe up the ground with the
army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the captain spoke, brandishing aloft his
free arm, Dugan sprang for him, aiming one of
his terrific swings. The captain, who was nimble
for his years, sidestepped swiftly, but not
quick enough to altogether avoid the blow. Dugan&rsquo;s
fist fell upon the box he was carrying with
a crunching, crackling sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; bawled the captain,
dancing about as if executing a hornpipe.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Vast afore they board yer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to bluff us,&rdquo; roared Dugan; &ldquo;we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before he could complete the sentence
there was an angry buzzing sound in the air,
like the drone of a sawmill cutting through a
tough, knotty log. Simultaneously, from the
broken box, there poured a dark stream of flying
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bees!&rdquo; shouted Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honey makers!&rdquo; exclaimed the experienced
Tubby, as the dark swarm surged down upon
Dugan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho! Here&rsquo;s where you get stung!&rdquo;
shouted the captain. &ldquo;Come close to me, boys,
and they won&rsquo;t hurt yer. Hey there, after &rsquo;em,
sting the scoundrels. Get your hooks inter that
yaller-faced lime juicer. Hooroh! That&rsquo;s the
time he got you! I guess them bees is thar with
ther business ends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these, and a dozen similar exclamations of
satisfaction, did the captain indulge, as the bees
angrily settled in swarms upon Dugan and his
Oriental companion. Rob, who had scrambled
to his feet, stood with the others close to Captain
Hudgins, and not a bee bothered them. The intelligent
insects knew their owner too well to attack
him. With Dugan and the Jap, however,
the case was different.</p>
<p>In vain did the two rascals wave their arms
about and beat the air in a desperate effort to free
themselves of their tormentors. It was of not
the slightest avail. The bees settled upon them
in angry masses in every exposed part. Some
even dropped down the Jap&rsquo;s back, and commenced
an attack there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Yelling like Comanches and whirling their
arms frenziedly about their heads, the two ruffians
fairly leaped the fence at one bound in their
pain and astonishment, and dashed off across
the fields toward the sea. About them, as they
ran, hovered a dark, angrily buzzing cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, come back thar! You&rsquo;ve took my prize
Eye-talian queen!&rdquo; the captain bawled at the top
of his voice, but, somewhat naturally, the fugitives
paid no attention to his words. Straight
for the sea they dashed, and, plunging into the
surf, rolled over and over in frantic attempts to
rid themselves of the clinging, stinging pests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; roared the captain. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as
good as a fair breeze arter a c&rsquo;am. But avast
thar, lads, how come you ter be in such a pickle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob, whose throat still showed the red marks
where Dugan&rsquo;s fingers had clutched, hastily explained,
being frequently interrupted by the captain
with exclamations of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belay thar! The deck-swabbing, land-lubbers!
Heave ahead!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Douse my glimmering
sidelights!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; opined the captain, when Rob had
concluded, &ldquo;I reckon them fellers is off on a long
cruise. They shore did heave their anchors sudden.
The worst of it is my bees has gone with
&rsquo;em, and I&rsquo;m generally mighty partic-lar who my
bees associates with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was now the captain&rsquo;s turn to explain
how he came to be on the road between Hampton
and the isolated De Regny place at such an opportune
moment. It appeared that the lone recluse
of Topsail Island had been to the distant
farm of a friend of his to aid him in wintering
some bees. He had taken a hive of his own
honey makers with him to obviate the chance of
being stung by the strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bees won&rsquo;t attack any one they knows, or
who they has an introduction to,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;Now you see them bees wouldn&rsquo;t touch any of
you boys. Now then, that&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby suddenly, clapping
one hand to the back of his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belay thar, lad, what&rsquo;s in yer rigging?&rdquo; demanded
the captain anxiously, rising from the
broken box which he had set down in the road
and had been using as a seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s a bee,&rdquo; rejoined the stout youth.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure it is, in fact. Wow! there&rsquo;s another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad began dancing about as if he were on
springs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you said they wouldn&rsquo;t sting any
one they were introduced to,&rdquo; said Rob, with a
half smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I guess in the hurry I must hev overlooked
them two,&rdquo; responded the captain, without
the quiver of an eyelid. Stepping up to the
capering Tubby, he deftly removed two bees from
the back of his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consarn ye!&rdquo; he said angrily, as if he were
addressing human beings. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with you, you mutinous dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys burst into a roar of laughter at such
talk addressed to bees, but the captain solemnly
assured them that the little winged creatures
understood every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will those that flew away come back to you?&rdquo;
inquired Rob, with interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, lad. They&rsquo;ve deserted ther ship,&rdquo; was
the rejoinder. &ldquo;But they done it in a good cause,
so I ain&rsquo;t got a word to say. But now let&rsquo;s trim
our sails, up anchor, and lay a course for home.
My boat&rsquo;s at the Inlet, and I&rsquo;ve got ter make ther
island by dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Skipper?&rdquo; asked Rob, as they accordingly
strode forward at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as good a shipmate as ever,&rdquo; was the response.
&ldquo;That thar dog gits more sensible every
day. I thought that time when he found them
uniforms thet Jack Curtiss and that rascal Bender
stole that he was just about the limit in dog
sense, but he does smarter things than that right
along. Speakin&rsquo; uv that, what&rsquo;s come of Jack
Curtiss and his piratical shipmates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys soon told him what they knew of
those two worthies. The captain shook his head
as he heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad craft them two,&rdquo; he observed, shaking
his head with renewed energy. &ldquo;But, to my
thinkin&rsquo;, they ain&rsquo;t much worse than that yaller-skinned
feller and his mate wot attacked you on
the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rob agreed; &ldquo;if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you,
we should have been in bad straits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t a bin fer them bees, lad, you
mean,&rdquo; amended the captain earnestly.</p>
<p>Soon after, they reached the Inlet and the captain
set out for the wharf, having exacted a
promise from the boys to visit him at an early
date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther island&rsquo;s seemed kind er lonesome since
the Boy Scout camp weighed anchor,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back again this summer,&rdquo; Rob assured
him.</p>
<p>When Rob reached home he found a telephone
message awaiting him. It was from Lieutenant
Duvall. The boy soon obtained connection with
his friend, one of the improvements at the mansion
having been the installation of a &rsquo;phone. The
lieutenant actually gasped as he listened. He
had trusted Dugan implicitly up to that afternoon,
and the revelation of his brutal attack following
the lad&rsquo;s disclosures of what they had
overheard in the hut had shaken his faith in human
nature tremendously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who to trust,&rdquo; he exclaimed
over the wire. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; in answer to Rob&rsquo;s question,
&ldquo;Dugan has not come back. When he does
I shall see that he is sent to Washington under
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dugan did not return to his duty with the
aero squad that night, nor on any succeeding
night. He and the Jap disappeared as completely
as though the earth had swallowed them.
A visit to the hut revealed a cot-bed and the
rough furniture the lads had noticed, but there
were no other traces of human occupancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Dugan,&rdquo; chorused the lads, as it became
certain that the ruffianly wearer of the
army uniform had vanished from their midst,
but could they have looked into the future they
would, perhaps, have changed their form of
farewell to &ldquo;Au revoir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MR. STONINGTON HUNT&mdash;SCHEMER.</span></h2>
<p>One afternoon, not long after the events related
in the last chapter, Paul Perkins had a
visitor. The caller was Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s father,
a man of past middle age, but flashily dressed
notwithstanding the plentiful sprinkling of gray
in his hair and carefully trimmed mustache. A
diamond ring sparkled on Mr. Hunt&rsquo;s left hand
and a similar stone blazed in his tie. He regarded
the wearing of the jewels as advertisements
of prosperity, and wore them with the
same satisfaction with which he looked upon his
new, gaudily furnished house on the hill above
the village, and his automobile&mdash;also very new&mdash;and
his numerous other possessions, all of
which, like himself, seemed somehow to savor
of veneer and to nowhere have the true ring of
solid wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>There was, perhaps, a reason for this. Stonington
Hunt had not always enjoyed &ldquo;ease and
a competency.&rdquo; His earlier years, in fact, had
been a hard struggle. He had been a messenger
boy for a firm of Wall Street brokers, but, by
natural sharpness and shrewdness, had worked
himself up till he obtained an interest in the business.
Then he branched out. His fortune grew
by leaps and bounds, till Stonington Hunt was
recognized as a wealthy man. The newspapers
had shown up several of his financial transactions
as being distinctly shady, but somehow he
had always been &ldquo;smart enough,&rdquo; as he would
have expressed it, to keep to windward of the
law. &ldquo;Smartness,&rdquo; in fact, was his gospel. He
preached it morning, noon, and night to his son.
Had Freeman had a different sort of father, he
might have been a different sort of boy. But
his mother having died when he was but a small
lad, he had fallen exclusively to his father&rsquo;s care.
Stonington Hunt had brought his son up to believe
it was disgraceful to be poor, and doubly
disgraceful to fail in anything one set out to do.
Principle, the elder Hunt had none, and he had
taught his son that a sense of honor was a useless
encumbrance. Such was the man who rang
Mrs. Perkins&rsquo;s front door bell and greeted her
with overdone effusiveness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is Paul in?&rdquo; he asked, after he had introduced
himself and expressed his intense gratification
at meeting such a charming lady.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Perkins, all in a flutter, invited her
glittering guest into the front parlor, drew up
the shades, which were rarely raised, and rejoined
that Paul was still at school, but would
be home shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is just as well,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Hunt,
displaying a row of white, gleaming teeth. &ldquo;He
is but a lad, and I have come to talk over something
which, perhaps, a woman of the world, an
intelligent woman like yourself, is more competent
to discuss than a mere boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul is a mighty bright boy,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Perkins, bridling somewhat in defense of Paul,
but coloring and simpering with pleasure at the
compliment paid to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Hunt amiably; &ldquo;a very
bright boy. A credit to the town, madam. But
Paul has been hiding his light under a bushel,
so to speak. He has not been radiating the effulgence
of inventive genius as he should; he has
been&mdash;in short,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Hunt, &ldquo;Paul
needs bringing out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bringing out?&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Perkins, to
whom much of this had been so much Greek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, my dear Mrs. Perkins, and I&mdash;Stonington
Hunt&mdash;am the man to do it. Why, I understand
that at this very moment he has in your
stables a remarkable&mdash;I may say, a wonderful
invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins had never heard the wagon
house referred to as &ldquo;stables&rdquo; before, and, quite
carried away by this glittering gentleman&rsquo;s kindly
interest and his magnificent manner, she rejoined
that Paul had got &ldquo;something of some sort&rdquo; out
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something, my dear madam,&rdquo; glowed Mr.
Hunt; &ldquo;it is more than a something. It is an
achievement. My boy Freeman&mdash;a dear friend
of your son&rsquo;s&mdash;told me about it&mdash;there&rsquo;s no objection
to my seeing it, I hope. I called on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;really, sir, I don&rsquo;t know if Paul
would like it,&rdquo; palpitated Mrs. Perkins. &ldquo;You
see, he&mdash;he is very particular about letting anybody
see the invention. He&rsquo;s trying for a patent
on it at Washington now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then it is not yet patented?&rdquo; There was
an eager catch in Mr. Hunt&rsquo;s voice. For an instant
his composed manner seemed to lose its icy
calm. But in a moment he was himself again.
&ldquo;He should certainly get it patented at once,
madam,&rdquo; he went on, in his usual oily tones&mdash;&ldquo;which
brings us at once to the point. I am here
to offer him a price for his invention if it seems
at all practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Perkins, quite overcome.
&ldquo;You would buy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam, I, Stonington Hunt, will buy it.
I am prepared to offer,&rdquo; he paused as if in doubt
whether to mention the sum in one breath, &ldquo;one
hundred dollars for the exclusive right to manufacture
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred dollars!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Perkins,
who had seen few lump sums of money since her
husband had died. &ldquo;Why, sir, it is only a plaything
of the boy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will let me see it, I will judge of that,&rdquo;
put in Mr. Hunt softly. &ldquo;Can we not go out to
your stable and view it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;Paul has the key,&rdquo; stammered Mrs.
Perkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the brat!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Hunt, and
then aloud he purred: &ldquo;But you have another
one, my dear madam, I don&rsquo;t doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; confessed Mrs. Perkins; &ldquo;there is one
on my dead husband&rsquo;s key ring. But I don&rsquo;t know
if Paul would like it. You see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; put in Mr. Hunt, in his
most impressive manner, &ldquo;I am a man of the
world, you are a woman of the world. Do we not
know better than children what is best for them?
I ask you, madam, as a woman of experience, do
we not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; trembled Mrs. Perkins,
quite carried away by all this. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
wait a second, sir, I&rsquo;ll get the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I do hope Paul won&rsquo;t be mad,&rdquo; she
thought, as she hastened upstairs on her errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easier than I thought,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Hunt,
gazing intently at the pink-eyed china dog with
blue spots that stood upon the mantel. &ldquo;If the
machine is what Freeman described it to be, there
should be money in it, and where there is money,
there you&rsquo;ll find Stonington Hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins, with a shawl thrown over her
head, was soon downstairs again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; she said, preparing to lead the
way, but as they emerged from the door and
started to take the brick path leading to the
wagon house, a sudden sound of approaching
boyish voices was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here comes Paul now, with three of his
friends,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Perkins, gazing across
the white picket fence and up the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the luck,&rdquo; ground out Mr. Hunt,
with a very unangelic expression on his face, &ldquo;it
will need all my tact to carry this through if the
cub proves obstinate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, madam,&rdquo; he said inquiringly, the next
minute, as Mrs. Perkins still lingered by the
fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, I&rsquo;ll leave it all to Paul now,&rdquo; gasped
Mrs. Perkins, secretly glad to be relieved of the
responsibility. &ldquo;Let him show his what-you-may-call-um
off. He can do it better than I
could. He understands it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shrug, Mr. Hunt bowed, and Mrs.
Perkins turned to re-enter the house. At that
moment Paul, with Rob, Merritt, and Tubby
about him, came through the gate. He seemed
excited. His checks were flushed. In his hand
he held a yellow piece of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray, mother!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;News from
Washington. They gave me this telegram as we
passed the office. It just came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it good news, my boy?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Perkins
solicitously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;The very best!&rdquo; cried the boy, in a delighted,
happy tone. &ldquo;Mr. Merrill tells me that he has
interested the government in my invention in
connection with its being used on the South Polar
expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good news, indeed, my boy!&rdquo; cried his
mother joyously. &ldquo;But, Paul, all this time we
have been forgetting that there is a gentleman
waiting to see you. Mr. Hunt, this is my boy,
and these are his friends, Rob Blake, Merritt
Crawford, and Tub&mdash;I mean Robert Hopkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of Rob Blake,&rdquo; said Mr. Hunt,
coming forward with a scowl. &ldquo;I have heard of
his friends, too. My business is with your lad,
Mrs. Perkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, sir, that it won&rsquo;t be much good
now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins, vanishing.</p>
<p>As soon as she had gone, Mr. Hunt &ldquo;opened
fire.&rdquo; He had decided in his own mind that a
quick, decisive manner would succeed best with
the quiet, dreamy Paul, so he called him aside
with an imperative gesture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, boy, I wish to speak with you,&rdquo;
he said, smiling with inward satisfaction as he
noted how quickly the inventive lad obeyed the
summons. Rob, Tubby, and Merritt, their books
under their arms, stood near the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the look of the father any more
than I do the son,&rdquo; declared Tubby emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what he wants with Paul?&rdquo; mused
Rob, as he watched the former Wall Street luminary
link his arm familiarly in the boy&rsquo;s and
walk off with him, talking earnestly. They
waited patiently, and presently Paul came hurrying
toward them with a wondering face. His
eyes were round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Mr. Hunt has
offered me a thousand dollars for the exclusive
rights to the motor-scooter&mdash;what do you think
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can they think of it but that it is a
splendid offer,&rdquo; put in Mr. Hunt, coming up.
&ldquo;Why, I have made it without even seeing the
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you overheard about the dispatch from
Washington,&rdquo; put in Rob quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Confound this boy. He&rsquo;s too sharp,&rdquo; thought
Mr. Hunt, whose desire to obtain the rights to
the machine had increased greatly since Paul
had imprudently announced his news from the
capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing to give this lad a royalty interest
in the sales, supposing the machine is practicable,&rdquo;
he said, in as conciliatory a tone as he
could adopt toward what were, in his lofty opinion,
&ldquo;a bunch of green kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Rob?&rdquo; asked Paul, his
eyes glowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will excuse us a minute, Mr. Hunt?&rdquo;
said Rob, and then, drawing his excited young
friend to one side, he began to talk to him earnestly.
The gist of Rob&rsquo;s advice was that Paul
would be very silly to close any sort of a deal in
a hurry. His father&rsquo;s friend in Washington was
evidently doing all that lay in his power to further
his interests, and if such a shrewd citizen
as Mr. Hunt was willing to make such an offer
on snap judgment, the machine must, in reality,
be worth much more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hunt, with a ghastly effort
at a pleasant smile, &ldquo;I trust that David has given
good counsel to Jonathan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; blurted out Paul. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
I care to do anything in the matter to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hunt. &ldquo;You refuse
my magnificent offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Paul is very young, sir,&rdquo; put in Rob,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s not quite sure that it <i>is</i> magnificent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not recognize you in this matter, boy!&rdquo;
majestically declared Mr. Hunt, who was rapidly
losing his temper. What he had thought would
be a simple matter was turning out to be far more
complex than he had imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he said, conquering his rage
with an effort, and turning to Paul with a smile
that was meant to be amiable, but which was
positively wolfish; &ldquo;at any rate, you will allow a
poor, inquisitive mortal to see this marvelous
craft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it,&rdquo; prompted Tubby, in a loud
whisper.</p>
<p>Hunt overheard, and turned quick as a flash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that a boy of your brains and
ability, Paul, would not allow himself to be led
by the nose by a lot of impudent puppies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or scheming promoters,&rdquo; put in Rob quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you, sir! Do you mean to insinuate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t insinuate anything. The insinuation
is your own,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to show me this machine,
boy?&rdquo; shouted Mr. Hunt, his temper now fairly
gone. Had Stonington Hunt possessed control
of his rage, he might have been many times a
millionaire, but his ungovernable temper had lost
him many a good chance, as he termed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t believe I care to,&rdquo; quavered
Paul, rather undecidedly. &ldquo;You see, it isn&rsquo;t patented
yet, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; hissed Tubby anxiously. He did
not know that Mr. Hunt was already in possession
of this important piece of knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brats make me tired,&rdquo; snarled the former
broker viciously. He turned with angry emphasis
and flourished his stick, striding toward
the gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Tubby politely held it open for him. The
broad grin on his face was unmistakable. It infuriated
Hunt to a still greater degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stonington Hunt was never beaten yet,&rdquo; he
snapped, &ldquo;and when he is, it won&rsquo;t be by a bunch
of half-baked school kids. You, sir&rdquo;&mdash;turning
angrily on Tubby&mdash;&ldquo;go to blazes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you,&rdquo; exclaimed the fat boy, with a low
bow, and holding the gate open to its fullest extent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ARMY AIRSHIP.</span></h2>
<p>Lieutenant Duvall proved as good as his
word. One afternoon, not long before cold
weather set in in real earnest, Rob received word
that if, on the ensuing Saturday, he and his two
chums would call at the old mansion they would
be enabled to see for themselves the aeroplane
with which the army was experimenting, Lieutenant
Duvall having been selected to make the
tests. If the weather proved right, the note
added, there was even a possibility that a short
flight might be attempted, just to show the boys
something of the newest idea in army equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I envy you fellows,&rdquo; said Paul Perkins
wistfully, when he heard of the contemplated excursion.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything to see an aeroplane
in action.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you will get a chance,&rdquo; said Rob
kindly, and when the banker&rsquo;s son reached home
that night he &rsquo;phoned to Lieutenant Duvall to
know if he could bring along a member of the
Eagle Patrol who was deeply interested in aeronautics.
The reply was in the affirmative, and
Paul&rsquo;s delight was huge when he received word
that he could be one of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw a real aeroplane except in a picture
before,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;and if I can get a
good look at one, I&rsquo;m going to try to work out an
idea I&rsquo;ve got in my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Mister Edison, Junior?&rdquo; teased
Tubby.</p>
<p>The boys were gathered in the wagon shed in
which the wonderful, though untried, motor-scooter
stood, awaiting the days when the Inlet
would be frozen over for its trial trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Paul, rather diffidently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid you fellows will laugh at me if I tell you
what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Merritt assured him, tossing
the core of a red-checked apple out of the open
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be mum as oysters,&rdquo; chimed in Rob.
&ldquo;Go ahead, Paul, unfold thy mar-velous plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of variation on the ice motor car,&rdquo;
explained Paul. &ldquo;It came to me last year when
we were sledding down Jones&rsquo;s hill outside the village.
It&rsquo;s just this, why couldn&rsquo;t a fellow fit a
sled with a pair of wings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; groaned Tubby, pretending to
roll off the empty nail keg on which he was seated,
and tapping his forehead meaningly. &ldquo;Another
bright young mind gone&mdash;clean gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Paul. Never mind him. He&rsquo;s got
a rush of fat to the head,&rdquo; laughed Merritt reassuringly,
for the diffident Paul had stopped and
colored up at the stout youth&rsquo;s ridicule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; explained Paul, &ldquo;that a sled gets
an awful impetus on a long glide down a hill.
Now, if only one could fix wings or planes to it
firmly enough, and equip it with a balancing tail,
I don&rsquo;t see why you couldn&rsquo;t make a skimmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might do it if you didn&rsquo;t break
your neck first,&rdquo; chuckled Tubby. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll
stick to the earth for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too fat to do anything else,&rdquo; chortled
Rob. &ldquo;But seriously, Paul, the idea sounds as if
it might be worked out. Maybe the aeroplane
will give you some ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try it as
soon as we get any sleighing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!&rdquo; burst out Tubby, rocking
back and forth. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s so young to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the laugh, in which Paul could not help
joining, had subsided, Rob spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen any more of Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sign of him,&rdquo; rejoined Paul. &ldquo;I guess
he&rsquo;s given up the idea of getting an interest in my
machine. What worries me a whole lot, though,
is that I&rsquo;ve heard nothing more from Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; comforted Rob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard my
dad say that it takes a year to do in Washington
what could be done anywhere else in a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it takes the Washingtons so long
to get within peeking view of the pennant,&rdquo; chuckled
Tubby, who was a close student of baseball
scores.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>With what anxiety the weather was watched
on the Saturday upon which the visit to the old
mansion was to be paid may be imagined. To
the boys&rsquo; delight, it dawned fair and clear, with
just enough of a sharp tang in the air to make it
pleasant. The boys had an early lunch and then
set out for the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad the inlet isn&rsquo;t frozen, and then we
could skim along in Paul&rsquo;s wonderful wind-jammer,&rdquo;
grumbled Tubby, who was somewhat
averse to walking.</p>
<p>It so happened that their way lay past the farm
of Jack Curtiss, and, as they passed it, they saw
that hulking lad strolling about the place, smoking
a cigarette. In the rear of the comfortable,
old-fashioned house, his father could also be seen,
hard at work splitting and piling wood with the
hired man to help him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Curtiss stared at the lads as they swung by,
but made no move to come toward them. By
this time he, of course, knew how the adventure
of the attack of Dugan and the Jap had turned
out, and seemingly he had no wish to test the
lads&rsquo; knowledge of who had instigated it.</p>
<p>About half a mile beyond the Curtiss farm lay
the estate of one Horatio Jeffords, among
whose possessions was a large and ferocious bull,
which had given trouble on more than one occasion
to passers by. For this reason, Jeffords
usually kept him tied up. As the boys swung
around a turn in the road and the stone-walled
way lay straight in front of them for some distance,
they perceived, running toward them at
top speed, two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those girls are running as if they were
scared of something,&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt, as they
came rushing toward the boys.</p>
<p>The words had hardly left his lips before the
lads saw what had alarmed them. Galloping
across the field, with head lowered and froth
flecking from his mouth, was Horatio Jeffords&rsquo;
savage bull. He was emitting angry roars as he
dashed on toward the girls, one of whom, the
boys could now see, was wearing a red sweater.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the bull! The bull! He&rsquo;ll kill us!&rdquo; they
cried shrilly as they neared the boys.</p>
<p>Indeed it looked as if the creature was bent on
inflicting serious injury upon the wearer of the
flaming article of wear, which had first attracted
his attention.</p>
<p>He leaped the low stone wall separating the
pasture lot from the road as nimbly as if he had
been a three-year-old colt. Then on he came, his
alarming bellow ringing out shrilly and angrily.
In a few seconds he was not more than a few
feet behind the girls.</p>
<p>With a wild cry one of them stumbled and
fell, and the next instant the infuriated creature
would have been upon her, goring her and
stamping out her life. But a sudden interruption
occurred.</p>
<p>A boyish figure, with coat off and waving
his hand, made a rapid leap forward, and before
the amazed bull could turn to attack this
new foe, his vision was suddenly blindfolded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>A coat had been thrown with deadly accuracy
through the air and had settled on the animal&rsquo;s
horns. Its folds hung down over his eyes, bewildering
him and shutting off his sight. The
animal shook his head and emitted angry roars,
but the more he endeavored to throw the coat off,
the closer it hung to his horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the girls out of the way!&rdquo; shouted Rob,
as coatless and flushed with his brave exertion,
he stood in the center of the road. But Merritt
and Tubby already had one girl upon her feet,
and the other stood a short distance down the
road. Both were pale and trembling at the imminence
of the danger they had escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl whom Rob
had saved by his quick presence of mind. The
bull, with a wild bellow, swung round and went
staggering off in the opposite direction, trying in
vain to rid himself of the bewildering coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least&mdash;that is, I mean to say, I don&rsquo;t know
how to thank you,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, glad to have been of service,&rdquo; said Rob
gallantly, as the other girl came up and began
adding her thanks and praise to that of her companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t worn that red sweater, you
wouldn&rsquo;t have attracted his attention,&rdquo; quoth
Tubby sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but they are the fashion this fall, and,
then, too, we had no idea that a wild bull would
be rushing around loose like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know who you boys are,&rdquo; said the
wearer of the red sweater, who now seemed quite
recovered from her fright. &ldquo;You are Rob Blake
and Tub&mdash;Mr. Hopkins and Merritt Crawford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Paul Perkins, the well-known inventor,&rdquo;
grinned Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you have the advantage of us,&rdquo; rejoined
Rob.</p>
<p>The girl laughed merrily at his embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Dale Harding&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
only got home from the West two days ago, and
my friend is a sister of Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Tubby exclaimed, in low voice. Then
he went on: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Miss Hunt has been
here very long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. I only arrived about a week
ago,&rdquo; said the young lady herself. &ldquo;I have been
at a finishing school up the Hudson. I think it&rsquo;s
much nicer here, though,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you have many more experiences like
that,&rdquo; laughed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. If there are always some
nice boys about to help us, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind,
should you, May?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; confessed Dale Harding&rsquo;s sister.
&ldquo;But come Helen, we must be walking on or we
shall be late for that appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture, Horatio Jeffords himself, red-faced
and panting, came in view. He was carrying
Rob&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal-kerlated I&rsquo;d ketch yer here,&rdquo; he puffed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you kep&rsquo; that pesky Hercules from
doin&rsquo; any harm. Had him tied up and can&rsquo;t figure
how in Sam Hill he got erway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the coat to Rob, explaining that the
bull had caught it in some brambles and shaken
it off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he is safely tied up now,&rdquo; said Helen
Hunt. &ldquo;I thought every minute the dreadful
creature would toss me on his horns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men hev got him up ter ther barn,&rdquo; Jeffords
assured her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hitch him with er chain
this time, you kin bet yer boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after the two parties separated, the girls
hastening toward Hampton and the boys walking
off with Farmer Jeffords, as he was going
in their direction a short distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nice boys,&rdquo; said Helen, as she and May
Harding walked along. &ldquo;Not a bit like what our
brothers told us about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you when they were pointed out to us
at the post office last night that they couldn&rsquo;t be as
mean as Freeman and Dale tried to make out,&rdquo;
responded Helen. &ldquo;They are awfully brave,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll get to know them better,&rdquo; went
on Dale Harding&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it depends on our brothers we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Helen Hunt assured her.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the boys had parted from
Farmer Jeffords.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, those girls are all right,&rdquo; declared Rob
enthusiastically, as they strode on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; laughed Tubby. &ldquo;Rob is smitten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; retorted Rob, with a red
face. &ldquo;You were bowing and scraping around
like a dancing master yourself. Yes, and Merritt,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only trying to be polite,&rdquo; protested
Merritt indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity they&rsquo;re not somebody else&rsquo;s sisters,&rdquo;
grunted Tubby mischievously, dodging a clip on
the ear which Rob reached out to give him.</p>
<p>It was not long before the dark hemlocks of
the De Regny mansion came into view. From
the summit of the little hill on which they stood
the boys could see the broad, smooth terrace and
the sparkle of the sea beyond. Hardly a breath
stirred the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have a flight, all right,&rdquo; exclaimed
Paul Perkins enthusiastically. &ldquo;Look! They&rsquo;re
busy down yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Sure enough they could see several small
speck-like figures moving about below them,
opening the big double doors of the green shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Race you to the bottom of the hill!&rdquo; shouted
Rob, and off dashed the Boy Scouts, running as
if their lives depended on it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TUBBY ESCAPES AN ORANGE BOMB.</span></h2>
<p>Whir-r-r-r-r-r!</p>
<p>What a terrific din the aeroplane&rsquo;s engine created,
as the white-winged cloud skimmer stood
outside the green shed! It was all the four soldiers,
hanging on to her stern braces, could do to
hold the struggling machine back. It appeared a
thing instinct with life, eager and striving to get
free and try its broad pinions against the blue.</p>
<p>The boys stood with round eyes and beating
hearts, watching while Lieutenant Duvall tuned
up the powerful one-hundred horse-power motor.
A smell of burned lubricants filled the air. Clouds
of oily, blue smoke rolled from the exhausts,
which spat lambent flames viciously as the powerful
motor vibrated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>To the soldiers standing about it was an old
story, but to the boys everything was new and
wonderful. As Lieutenant Duvall stopped the
motor to adjust a spark plug connection, they
pressed forward to examine the craft. Paul, as
may be imagined, was as interested in the smallest
wire and coupling as he was in the mighty engine
or the broad white planes.</p>
<p>Suddenly the small boy gave an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, sir!&rdquo; he cried to the lieutenant.</p>
<p>The officer hastened to his side. Paul was examining
one of the cross wires. The filament,
made of the stoutest drawn steel, formed an important
brace to the upper plane. The lad&rsquo;s sharp
eyes had detected that the soldering of its connection
was almost worn through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, boy!&rdquo; exclaimed the officer, as
he saw the defect to which Paul had called attention.
&ldquo;That would have given me a bad tumble
if you <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i> noticed it. Here, Mulloy&rdquo;&mdash;addressing
one of the soldiers&mdash;&ldquo;get me the soldering
outfit. Quick, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With soldierly alertness, the man was off on
his errand. Lieutenant Duvall employed the time
of his absence explaining the various details of
the machine to the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about the equalizer?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not attached to-day,&rdquo; explained the officer.
&ldquo;The main object of the device is to steady
the plane when the operator desires to launch an
explosive from his seat. He naturally has to
shift, and the equalizer is to take up that shifting
motion and distribute it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Tubby sagaciously, although it
is doubtful if the fat boy did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are going to practice dropping explosives?&rdquo;
asked Rob.</p>
<p>The officer&rsquo;s face took on a queer expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to call that an army secret,
my boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If all goes well, Hampton
may become a famous place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this mysterious utterance, the boys had
to be content. Mulloy returned at this moment
with the solder, and the lieutenant adjusted the
weak spot as skilfully as a machinist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;An aviator has to know how to do everything
about his engine,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;supposing he
should drop in a country without a machine shop
in reaching distance, or in any enemy&rsquo;s country,
if he couldn&rsquo;t make his own repairs, he would be
in a bad fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are all these men trained in that way?&rdquo; inquired
Rob.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Duvall nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one of them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are all
from Fort Myer. So was that deserting rascal,
Dugan. He was the most expert mechanic I
ever saw. In fact, I have heard since his desertion
that there was good reason for his skill.
Under the name of Beasley, he was one of the
best-known safe crackers in the country before
he reformed and entered the army with an assumed
name. He was a splendid workman,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer gave a sigh over the dereliction of
Dugan. His professional side was affected by
the man&rsquo;s rascality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing has been heard of him since he deserted?&rdquo;
asked Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; rejoined the officer, buckling
on his leggings and adjusting his queer-shaped,
padded cap, with goggles attached to its front
part.</p>
<p>A few seconds later he was in the driver&rsquo;s seat,
and had his hands on the two levers which, by
quadrants and chains, controlled the warping of
the wings and rudder. The engine controls also
led from these levers, while the motor could be
stopped altogether by a motion of the foot on a
small metal pedal.</p>
<p>Two soldiers ran to the propeller, a six-foot
affair, and began swinging it &ldquo;against the compression&rdquo;
of the motor. After a few rocks of
the two-bladed driving apparatus, an explosion
burst from the motor, and presently it was roaring
away at full blast. A squad of men held it
back, however, awaiting the aviator&rsquo;s signal to
&ldquo;let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last it came&mdash;a backward sweep of one
gauntleted hand.</p>
<p>Whir-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Like some scared live thing, the winged man-bird
shot forward, scuttling over the smooth surface
of the bricked terrace. Absolutely enthralled,
the boys stood, with eyes as big as saucers
and their mouths half open, in blank astonishment.
As the contrivance, after a short scud,
began to lift, they broke into an involuntary
cheer. The next instant a distance of several feet
interposed between the flying machine and the
ground. With a graceful turn, the officer
brought his flier round, and now came roaring
through the air directly above the boys&rsquo; heads.
As he did so, he gave a shout, and before the astonished
onlookers could utter a sound, a round,
yellow object came hurtling down at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bomb! Look out!&rdquo; yelled one of the soldiers,
with well-assumed terror, leaping backward.</p>
<p>In his haste to avoid the explosion of the yellow
globe, Tubby fairly fell over and went rolling
along the smooth ground like a ball. Rob
and the others jumped back with blanched cheeks
and frightened eyes, in scarcely less haste. Evidently,
by accident, the officer had dropped a
deadly explosive&mdash;or so it seemed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The next instant, however, a roar of laughter
went up at the boys&rsquo; expense.</p>
<p>What had been dropped was an orange. It
struck the ground with a terrific splash, scattering
juice and pulp in all directions. It was a little
joke of the lieutenant&rsquo;s, who frequently used
oranges or eggs at bomb-dropping practice.</p>
<p>The relieved boys could hear his merry laugh
as he sailed by, far above them, and rapidly
soared higher in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Won&rsquo;t get me that way again,&rdquo;
grunted Tubby, as, amid a roar of laughter, he
picked up his rotund form and joined the others.</p>
<p>For half an hour or more the officer swooped
and circled above them, appearing to delight in
the exercise as much as a wheeling hawk on a
summer&rsquo;s day. Then he descended, and made a
landing on the terrace as neatly as if he had just
driven up in an automobile. Springs, geared to
the pneumatic-tired wheels, broke the force of
the landing, and, after one or two light bounces,
the machine came to a standstill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; cried the officer, laughing and
turning to Rob as the machine, for the time being,
terminated its flight.</p>
<p>He indicated a seat beside him, with an upright
back and covered with dark-green padding.
Rob did not hesitate, but stepped boldly
forward. One of the soldiers offered him a pair
of goggles, which he drew on. Then he climbed
into the seat and gripped the side handles
tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break the news to your folks,&rdquo; howled
Tubby, but the rest of his jocose remarks were
drowned in the roar of the motor. The next instant
they were off. Rob&rsquo;s breath seemed to be
forced backward down his throat by the rapidity
of the motion. He gasped and choked, and hung
onto his hand rails till the paint flaked off against
his palms. The aeroplane, before it arose,
seemed to act just like a bucking broncho. Its
motions reminded Rob very much of the cayuse
he had ridden at Harry Harkness&rsquo; ranch on that
memorable morning when the cowpunchers gathered
to see his battle with the broncho.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Suddenly, however, the see-saw motion
changed to a delightful, gliding sensation. It
felt like riding along upon the softest feather
mattress in the world. They had left the ground
and were actually flying. Rob&rsquo;s heart gave a
bound at the idea. He was certainly the first boy
in the vicinity of Hampton to have such an experience.
His first flash of fear had left him
now, and he glanced at the officer seated beside
him. Lieutenant Duvall&rsquo;s face was calm and unperturbed,
and Rob felt ashamed of the feeling
of fright he had experienced before the machine
took the air.</p>
<p>Up and up they rose. Once Rob looked down,
but he didn&rsquo;t do it any more. Somehow it made
him feel pale and empty to realize that between
his shoe soles and the ground lay a quarter of a
mile of empty space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes ahead,&rdquo; the officer advised,
and Rob thereafter did so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>But his ride was not destined to become monotonous
with such an aviator as the army officer
at the levers. Suddenly the machine gave a
downward, forward dip, and began rushing to
the ground, or rather the ground appeared to be
rushing up toward it.</p>
<p>It was all Rob could do to keep from crying
out. He firmly believed that an accident had
happened and that they would be dashed to bits
when the aeroplane struck the ground. His
mouth grew dry with terror, and he could have
no longer checked a terrified shout, when all at
once the motion ceased; or, rather, it altered.
The descent was checked when within twenty
feet of the ground, and up and round they
swung, landing a few minutes after as lightly
as a wafted feather upon the broad, smooth terrace
of the De Regny mansion. How the old
marshal would have gasped if he could have witnessed
the antics of this new weapon of warfare
cavorting above his ancient domain, from which
he had watched so many weary days for his emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the officer, with a twinkle in his
eye as Rob, a bit shaky still from his terrible
fright, clambered to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, taking off his goggles,
&ldquo;It was pretty strenuous work, but I enjoyed
every minute of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for your friends,&rdquo; said the officer, but
Tubby had strangely vanished, and only Merritt
and Paul could avail themselves of the invitation.
They both enjoyed rides, and Paul
proved so apt a young aviator that on a second
trip aloft he was even allowed to handle the
levers, at a safe distance above the ground,
however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys certainly have plenty of pluck,&rdquo;
said the officer, after the sport of the afternoon
was over. &ldquo;Some day I may take you for a
cross-country ride, or when we start real bomb-dropping
work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot&mdash;that&rsquo;s a service secret,&rdquo; he said
mystifyingly.</p>
<p>Not until the aeroplane was safely housed did
Tubby emerge, and then he had to undergo a fine
cross fire of joshing, you may be sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; philosophically remarked the
stout youth to himself; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not built for flying,
and walking is good enough for me, unless I can
own an automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rob reached home that evening his
mother told him that there was a visitor to see
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in the library,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Rob hastily removed the grime and dirt of his
aerial trip, and, wondering who the caller could
be, hastened into the room in which the guest was
waiting. He gave a cry of surprise, as, in the
twilight, he recognized Dale Harding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to talk things over,&rdquo; said Freeman
Hunt&rsquo;s particular chum, extending a hand. Rob
took it and shook it heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dale,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WOODS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My sister told me all about it,&rdquo; burst out Dale,
plunging into the object of his mission without
any preliminary skirmishing. &ldquo;It was a mighty
brave thing to do, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; rejoined Rob. &ldquo;It was just a Boy
Scout good turn. Say no more about it, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must,&rdquo; hurriedly went on Dale, bringing
out his words rapidly, as if he had nerved
himself to the performance of an unpleasant, but
necessary task. &ldquo;I&mdash;I want to tell you, Rob,
that I feel pretty small and cheap and mean over
the way I&rsquo;ve let those fellows jolly me into annoying
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Dale. Never mind about
what&rsquo;s past,&rdquo; Rob said; &ldquo;but in the future let&rsquo;s
make this talk have some good effect. Let the
Hawks and the Eagles get together. I know
that the rank and file of the Hawks are friendly
toward us, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet they are,&rdquo; blurted out Dale. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only Hunt&rsquo;s influence that drew them apart, and
it&rsquo;s this same influence that&rsquo;s keeping them there.
We could get together to-morrow if it wasn&rsquo;t for
Hunt and one or two of his cronies. I&rsquo;m
ashamed to think that I was one of them, but it&rsquo;s
over now. I&rsquo;m disgusted with Hunt&mdash;through
with him for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob saw that the boy was agitated by something
more than the mere mention of Hunt&rsquo;s
name. He appeared to be anxious to say something
more, but apparently it stuck in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what has Hunt done recently to make
you so disgusted with him?&rdquo; asked Rob, by way
of giving the other a lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; exclaimed Dale;
&ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you guessed who put up that job on
you when that soldier and the Jap attacked you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered how they came to know
we would be traveling by that road,&rdquo; said Rob.
&ldquo;It puzzled me a good deal, but I attributed it to
accident, for lack of a better explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was no accident,&rdquo; Dale assured him.
&ldquo;Hunt and Jack Curtiss found that a secret passage
ran from the beach to the grounds of the
old De Regny house. They sneaked through it
the day that you were out there, and lay in a
clump of bushes close behind you while you
talked. They thought they saw a chance to get
even and hastened off to set those two fellows
on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickens they did!&rdquo; exclaimed the other.
&ldquo;That explains a whole lot that wasn&rsquo;t clear before.
Hunt is a worse young rascal than I
thought him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly is,&rdquo; agreed Dale. &ldquo;I was disgusted
clear through when they told me about it,
and said so. But Hunt and the others threatened
to do me up if I said anything to you, so I kept
quiet for a while. But when my sister told me
that it was you who had rescued them from that
bull of Jeffords&rsquo;, I just had to come and see you,
and tell you how sorry I was. I hope you&rsquo;ll be
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I will,&rdquo; said Rob heartily, &ldquo;and I
hope we can make this a means of getting the
two patrols together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only stumbling block now is Freeman
Hunt. He&rsquo;ll do all he can to work against us,&rdquo;
went on Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see that he can do much,&rdquo; rejoined Rob,
after a few minutes of thought. &ldquo;If the patrol
doesn&rsquo;t want him and can show good cause why
he should not be at the head of the Hawks, they
can appeal to the scoutmasters and elect a successor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some more talk the two boys separated,
but that conversation proved the beginning of the
end for Freeman Hunt. A proposal was made
to him some days later to adjust the differences
between the Hawks and the Eagles, but he stubbornly
refused to retreat from his position. In
the meantime, the scoutmasters, Mr. Blake and
Commodore Wingate, had heard something of
the difficulties of the two patrols, and the result
was a peremptory order to Hunt to adjust all
differences at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll quit first,&rdquo; grunted Hunt, when this news
was conveyed to him. &ldquo;That kid Blake wants
to own the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the Hawks finally was as good
as his word, and, after a stormy scene in their
armory, he strode out of the organization. Soon
after Dale Harding was elected to the leadership
in his place. Lem Lonsdale and Hunt&rsquo;s
other cronies, refusing to follow their leader out,
still remained, however, as sources of trouble.
Thus, for the time being, ended Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s
association with the Boy Scouts. But he was not
the sort of lad to accept defeat any more easily
than his father. It was noticed that soon after
his resignation from the ranks of the Hawks,
Hunt, Jack Curtiss, and Bill Bender formed an
inseparable triumvirate, but for a time they gave
no sign of making mischief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>With the first sprinkle of snow, the boys of
Hampton began to get out their guns&mdash;those of
them who possessed any&mdash;and little was talked
of but rabbit hunting and the merits and demerits
of various hounds. The aeroplane experiment
grounds were closed till spring, only a
small detachment of soldiers being left behind
to look after things, and see that no one molested
the place. Old Captain Hudgins, as was his winter
habit, had deserted his island, except for occasional
visits, and would not go back to it till
the early spring. In the meantime, he meant to
pass the chilly months in a small-cottage lying
a little outside Hampton to the east. Of course,
it was right on the coast, for the captain could
not bear to be out of sight or sound of the sea.</p>
<p>One Saturday Rob and his inseparable companions
set out for the woods with their guns,
determined to bring home enough rabbits for
three separate stews. Their way led them up
over Jones&rsquo;s Hill, where Paul meant to try out
his winged sled when opportunity offered, past
a few scattered dwellings on the outskirts of the
town, and then into a tangle of woods and
brush interspersed with sandy clearings covered
with dried, brown grass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Separating, they started through the woods,
and every now and then the report of a shotgun
rang out sharply on the frosty air. It was evident
that they were having good sport, or at least
getting plenty of shots.</p>
<p>Hardly had they disappeared into the brush
before another group of hunters, leading a big
liver-and-white pointer on leash, emerged into
the roadway from a clump of bushes, behind
which they had ducked as the three boys came
into view.</p>
<p>The trio that had so suddenly appeared from
what was, apparently, a hiding place consisted of
Freeman Hunt, Jack Curtiss, and Bill Bender.
All carried guns, and four rabbits carried by Jack
showed that they had had some success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose those brats are going to scare
everything within five miles now,&rdquo; muttered
Jack, as they watched the Boy Scouts vanish
into the woods. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a fine bunch of hunters.
I&rsquo;ll bet there isn&rsquo;t one of them could hit a
barn door if he were locked in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; muttered Freeman Hunt, in a
surly tone. &ldquo;Young muckers, I owe them a long
score, and they&rsquo;ll have to settle it before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they did kind of knock you down and
then rub it in, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; grinned Bill Bender,
fumbling with the breech of his gun.</p>
<p>Freeman did not relish this reference to his
recent troubles, and an angry flush rose to his
cheeks as he burst out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst thing they ever did. I&rsquo;ll get
even with them if it&rsquo;s the last thing I do. I
haven&rsquo;t thought up anything yet, but I will, and
don&rsquo;t you forget it. I hate them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no use letting them have all the sport,&rdquo;
rejoined Jack Curtiss. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut into the wood
here, and then the old dog can nose up all the
game they drive this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon Rob found himself alone, in
a small clearing, surrounded with scrub oak and
sea-stunted pines&mdash;a vegetation peculiar to that
region.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>He paused to listen for some sound of his
companions, and, as he did so, he heard, quite
near at hand, as it seemed, a crashing sound in
the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, fellows?&rdquo; he called out; but there
was no answer, and in place of the crackling of
the brush there was dead silence. Somewhere,
far off, he could hear the steady blows of a
woodsman&rsquo;s axe, but that was the only interruption
to the silence of the winter&rsquo;s afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was a deer,&rdquo; reflected Rob, as no
answer came to his call. &ldquo;They get off that millionaire
Grogan&rsquo;s place once in a while. Guess
that must have been one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at the two rabbits he held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much for an afternoon&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; he
smiled. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was beginning to sink quite low, and
Rob thought to himself that he would have to
be getting back. He was turning with this object
in view when a sudden sound behind him
attracted his attention, and a big liver-and-white
pointer ran through the clearing. Its nose was
on the ground and it paid no attention to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody else hunting round here,&rdquo; thought
Rob. &ldquo;Queer, though, I&rsquo;ve heard no other
shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later he plunged into the brush,
striking out toward the southwest. As he entered
the tangle, and, bending low, began pushing
his way through it with his broad, young
shoulders, something happened.</p>
<p>A flash of fire, so close that it almost singed
his hair, followed by a deafening report, and
the whistle and spatter of shot among the leaves,
brought him to halt with a gasp at his narrow
escape.</p>
<p>Some one had fired a shotgun almost in his
ear. A fraction of an inch and he would have
been badly wounded, if not killed. As he stood
there, angry at the unknown hunter&rsquo;s carelessness
and palpitating with the sudden shock, there
came a great crashing in the brush. Somebody
was evidently making off at top speed. Perhaps
it was the man who had caused the accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; shouted Rob, finding his voice at last.
&ldquo;Hi! come back there, you! You pretty nearly
shot me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>But the crashing kept on. Evidently whoever
had fired the shot was in hot haste to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine way to sneak out of a careless
accident,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob indignantly, hurling
his voice after the unknown.</p>
<p>A sudden hot wave of suspicion and anger
swept over him as he spoke. Was it an accident?
Would any one who had come so close to jeopardizing
a human life dash off like a detected criminal?
Would he not stand his ground and explain
matters?</p>
<p>Sorely perplexed, Rob stood a while listening
to the further sounds of the retreating individual
who had imperiled him. As he paused, rooted to
the spot, something flashed across his path and
vanished the same way as had the mysterious
shooter. It was the same liver-and-white pointer
he had noticed before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You belong to him,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, as the
dog vanished. &ldquo;I never saw you before, but I&rsquo;ll
know you if we meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MR. HUNT DELIVERS A TELEGRAM.</span></h2>
<p>The morning after Rob&rsquo;s narrow escape,
Stonington Hunt entered the Western Union office
in Hampton in some excitement and filed a
telegram. It was addressed to a former business
friend of his, and related to what progress
he had made in acquiring the right to manufacture
Paul Perkins&rsquo;s queer machine. Had it told
the truth, it would have said, &ldquo;Little hope.&rdquo;
But that was not the elder Hunt&rsquo;s way. His
dispatch read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Progress favorable. Think I can land it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Hunt handed the message over to Blinky
Dibbs, the operator, messenger boy and manager
of the office, he smile grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid there&rsquo;s more poetry than truth in that
message,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not going
to give up hope. The more I think of it, the
more I&rsquo;m convinced there is money in that motor
ice sleigh. Why, one could sell them like hot
cakes at winter resorts, and there&rsquo;s that government
contract for the Polar expedition. Stonington,
my boy, you&rsquo;ve got to get your hands on
that machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point of his meditations, his eyes fell
on an undelivered message lying on the key table
before the operator. The former financier&rsquo;s
sharp eyes scanned it greedily. As he comprehended
what the dispatch was, his brow clouded
angrily. The message was for Paul Perkins, and
read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Things here satisfactory, but Washington
moves slowly. On no account consider other offer.
Confident I can put deal with government
through.
<span class="jr">Merrill.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; whistled Hunt, in a low key. &ldquo;So
that&rsquo;s the way the wind blows.&rdquo; He wrinkled
his brow for a minute in deep thought, and, as
Mr. Hunt&rsquo;s thoughts usually materialized speedily
into action, he did not remain long in meditation.
He pulled a &ldquo;receiving blank&rdquo; toward
him and rapidly wrote on it. Then he slipped it
in an envelope and, having written an address on
it, pocketed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get my message off yet, Dibbs?&rdquo; he inquired,
although his sharp eyes had seen that the operator
had not yet succeeded in raising the New
York office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; responded Blinky, pounding away at
&ldquo;N. Y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; volunteered Mr. Hunt,
with his most amiable smile. &ldquo;Got any messages
you wish delivered in the direction in which I&rsquo;m
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way is that?&rdquo; asked Blinky, keeping
up his clickety-click.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down Beach Street. I have some business at
Paul Perkins&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; exclaimed Blinky, galvanizing
into remembrance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a message here for
young Perkins. Would you mind taking it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; declared Mr. Hunt, emphasizing
his willingness with a smile of triumph.
Dibbs had fallen into the trap almost too easily.
A few minutes later Mr. Hunt strode out of the
office and set off at a brisk pace for Paul Perkins&rsquo;s
home. In his pocket he carried the message
from Washington, and he intended it should not
leave that receptacle till he was ready to destroy
it. Mr. Hunt whistled cheerily as he walked
down the street. His chest swelled with exultation
till the buttons of his overcoat were seriously
strained. He felt that he had accomplished a
stroke of real business.</p>
<p>A sound of hammering from the wagon house
as he reached the inventive scout&rsquo;s home apprised
the astute plotter that the boy he was in search
of was at work on the machine he desired so ardently
to acquire. Without making his visit
known to Mrs. Perkins, the father of Freeman
Hunt softly walked over the withered turf to the
wagon shed door, and the first thing Paul knew
of his presence was when his dark shadow fell
across the sheet of metal on which the lad was
working.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Paul gave a little start as he looked up and saw
who it was that had dropped in upon him so unexpectedly.
The look of his face must have told
Hunt that he was not a welcome visitor, but this
did not worry such a veteran of diplomacy as
now faced the lad. Paul, however, had presence
of mind enough to drop his hammer and come
toward the door before the observant Mr. Hunt
had done more than take in the outlines of the
machine he was constructing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, good morning, Paul,&rdquo; Hunt had said, as
the boy looked up. &ldquo;Have you time for a little
chat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so, Mr. Hunt,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.
&ldquo;Let us go in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have it here. It is too early in the
day to make a call, and your mother is probably
busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul quite saw through this, and acted more
decisively than he would have believed it possible
for him to do. Coming forward, he laid his
hand on the door, stepped through the opening,
and an instant later he had closed the portal on
the outside and slipped a big padlock into its
hasp. If Hunt was annoyed, he did not show it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for not wishing me to see
the machine,&rdquo; he purred. &ldquo;It is quite understandable;
quite natural, after what occurred the
other day. I deeply regret I lost my temper.
It was the interest I felt in your welfare, though,
that angered me when you refused my proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said Paul bluntly. &ldquo;I thought you
were mad with Rob Blake for butting in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have seemed so; I may have seemed
so,&rdquo; said Mr. Hunt, with such regret in his tones
that the soft-hearted Paul began to feel sorry
for him. &ldquo;I have a terrible temper, and when I
saw that my good offer was likely to be rejected
by you because of your willingness to listen to
bad advice, I confess that my fury arose and
mastered me. But, Paul, I am of a forgiving
nature. I don&rsquo;t cherish any more anger against
you. I came here this morning to repeat my
offer, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt broke off and dived into his overcoat
pocket. Apparently, he had just recollected
the yellow envelope he now drew out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Paul, my boy, I almost forgot! I&rsquo;ve a
message here for you. Dibbs asked me to deliver
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; exclaimed the boy, taking the
message. &ldquo;Will you excuse me if I open it? It
may be news from Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News you little expect,&rdquo; snarled Mr. Hunt to
himself, his wolfish smile growing more pronounced.
The envelope he had slipped to the lad
contained the message he himself had scribbled
after he had seen the real dispatch. Paul&rsquo;s face
blanched as he read the brief, short message,
which appeared to be genuine enough. At least,
he, of course, had no grounds for doubting its
authenticity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can do nothing more in regard to ice motor,&rdquo;
he read, with a sense of bitter shock. &ldquo;Government
declines to use it. Sorry, but negotiations
are definitely closed. Merrill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad news I hope?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Hunt
solicitously. Paul raised a troubled face. He
was a lad utterly unused to guile or deception,
and he therefore blurted out his trouble. He
even read off the contents of the message, which
was hardly necessary, as Hunt himself had written
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad; too bad,&rdquo; said Mr. Hunt, wagging
his head slowly and assuming a sympathetic leer.
&ldquo;But, Paul, it&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows nobody
any good. If the government doesn&rsquo;t know a
good thing when it sees it, I do. My offer is still
open. I&rsquo;ll go five hundred dollars higher, in fact.
What do you say to fifteen hundred dollars for
the rights to the machine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hardly know what to say,&rdquo; stuttered the
confused lad. The sudden dashing of his hopes
at Washington led him to be willing to accept
almost anything. To people in the circumstances
of the widow Perkins and her son, fifteen
hundred dollars looked an immense sum.</p>
<p>Hunt noted the boy&rsquo;s hesitation, and he
hastened to strike while the iron was hot. He
produced a fountain pen and a check book, with
a wizard-like flourish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, persuasively, &ldquo;say the word
and I&rsquo;ll write you a check now. You give me
a receipt saying that you accept the money in
consideration of all rights in the machine, and
the thing is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; hesitated Paul, miserably,
&ldquo;come inside, Mr. Hunt, and I&rsquo;ll fix up
the paper you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Stonington, my boy!&rdquo; chuckled
the rascal to himself, as he turned to follow the
boy into the house, &ldquo;I guess this is where I get
even on those brats who interfered the other day,
and make a nice little sum besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as they had their feet on the lower step
leading to the side door there came a hail from
the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul&mdash;oh, Paul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Rob Blake&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Hunt paled as he heard it, but recovered himself
the next instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, he could never find it out,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I wish he had kept away till I put the
business through, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hul-lo, Rob, I&rsquo;m glad to see you,&rdquo; cried Paul,
&ldquo;come on in. I want to ask your advice in something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I must protest against that,&rdquo; sputtered
Mr. Hunt, &ldquo;this is a confidential matter, my boy.
You have pledged yourself to sell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I don&rsquo;t think I have,&rdquo; rejoined
Paul, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m not going to
sell till I ask Rob&rsquo;s advice. He knows a lot more
about business than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound him, I think he does,&rdquo; grunted
Hunt, but he added aloud as Rob came through
the gate, &ldquo;Quite right, Paul, quite right. But
independence in business is the keynote of success.
Ahem, Mr. Blake, you are looking well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, bluntly, taking
no pains to hide his dislike of Mr. Hunt; then,
without paying further attention to the leering
plotter, he turned to Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your telegram, Paul? I dropped in at
the telegraph office on my way down and Blinky
told me he had sent a message to you by Mr.
Hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I got it,&rdquo; said Paul, bitterly, &ldquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad news, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;The worst. Washington won&rsquo;t touch the ice
motor with a pair of tongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look,&rdquo; said Rob, extending his hand for
the message which Paul had drawn from his
pocket as he spoke. But before the inventive lad
could pass the paper to his chum, Freeman Hunt&rsquo;s
hand darted out and intercepted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look at it one moment,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something that wasn&rsquo;t quite clear when
I saw it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t see it before,&rdquo; protested Paul.
&ldquo;You gave it to me and I told you what was in it.
Then you made me your offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you had better give me that dispatch,
Mr. Hunt,&rdquo; said Rob, quietly, but with an ominous
glitter in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I get ready, my young whipper-snapper,&rdquo;
was the rejoinder, &ldquo;and now if you will
clear out for a minute, Paul and I have some
business together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to buy the rights to the machine
for $1,500,&rdquo; volunteered Paul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he does, does he?&rdquo; snorted Rob. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;d give you more than that myself. This fellow
is after you to make money out of you, Paul,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you, you cub,&rdquo; roared Stonington
Hunt, once more losing his temper and springing
forward, but something in Rob&rsquo;s steady gaze
made him lower his uplifted arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to let me see that message?&rdquo;
demanded Rob, in whose mind a suspicion had
now grown into a definite certainty. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt&rsquo;s answer was to tear the sheet of paper
in two, but before he could reduce it to smaller
bits and scatter them broadcast, Rob was upon
him, and with one powerful wrench of the man&rsquo;s
wrists had gained possession of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested for assault!&rdquo; stormed
Hunt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see the constable, I&rsquo;ll have you put
in jail! I&rsquo;ll appear against you as a dangerous
character, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute, there,&rdquo; warned Rob, who
had fitted the two torn bits of crumpled paper
together. &ldquo;If you go to doing anything like that
I may have to turn the tables by appearing
against you on a more serious charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt paled, and his eyes glittered strangely,
but he tried to bluff it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What charge, boy?&rdquo; he demanded, his words
seeming to choke him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That of forgery,&rdquo; shot out Rob. &ldquo;This message
is a bit of rank deceit. It hasn&rsquo;t even got
a time stamp or an office number on it. You&rsquo;d
better get out of here, Mr. Hunt, and&mdash;quick,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt made a step forward, and then appeared
to change his mind. He turned so white with
rage that his face seemed like a bit of carved
marble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young cur,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;This is the
second time. You came near getting your deserts
in the wood yesterday. Look out for the
third time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob laughed as the fellow slunk off, but as
Hunt strode up the street with as much bravado
as he could assume the boy&rsquo;s face grew grave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like father, like son, dad says sometimes,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;I heard in the village that Freeman
Hunt had been after rabbits yesterday. Now I
know who owns the pointer. What a pair of
rascals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul looked blank. He had scarcely understood
the scene that had just transpired. Unacquainted
with the routine of a telegraph office
he had failed to detect that the required marks
were lacking on Hunt&rsquo;s forged dispatch. He
looked at Rob in a mystified way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it mean, Rob?&rdquo; he asked, wonderingly.
&ldquo;Was Hunt trying to <i>bunco</i> me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the word, old fellow,&rdquo; said Rob,
throwing his arm affectionately around the
younger boy&rsquo;s neck, &ldquo;but we checkmated him just
in time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BOY WHO FLEW.</span></h2>
<p>One of the features of winter life at Hampton
was the annual bob-sled races down the steep,
long hill outside the town, known as Jones&rsquo;s Hill.
Other villages on Long Island, notably Huntington,
had the same sort of carnivals, and they
were always attended by people from a wide
radius around. Neighboring villages sent teams
and sleds to compete for prizes, and much merry
sport resulted. For weeks beforehand the events
were talked about, and sometimes&mdash;in the case
of a spill&mdash;the contestants had reason to remember
the day for weeks afterward. Although the
&ldquo;Bob Sled Carnival,&rdquo; as it was called, would not
come off till three days after Christmas, the boys
of Hampton were busy over their preparations
for some time before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going to enter a sled this year, Rob?&rdquo; asked
Tubby, one afternoon in early December, as they
were on their way home from the Academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; rejoined Rob, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that big
ten-seater. We might enter her with an Eagle
Patrol team, and race her against a Hawk sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully,&rdquo; cried Merritt Crawford, &ldquo;that would
be a great scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo; chimed in about a dozen
lads, who were walking with our three boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not send a challenge to the Aquebogue
fellows?&rdquo; piped up little Joe Digby; &ldquo;they have
a patrol over there now&mdash;The Wolves, they call
themselves. Maybe they would enter a team
against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they would,&rdquo; agreed Rob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write
a challenge to-night. Let&rsquo;s see, Howard Major
is their leader, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;ll be sure to accept, too.
Howard steered the Aquebogue bob-sled last
year.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when we let Aquebogue win the cup,&rdquo;
laughed Rob, referring to a silver cup, the gift
of the village boards of six villages, which was
annually contested for. &ldquo;This year us fellows
want to wake up and win it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it, too,&rdquo; several of the lads assured
him, as the group came to a point where they
separated and went their several ways. Paul
Perkins had been an interested, if silent, participator
in the plans, but when he found himself
alone with his three friends he launched enthusiastically
into a description of the kind of sled
with which he was going to startle the community
and their guests at the carnival. The
lad had been spending odd hours over the construction
of his winged glider, and he was pretty
certain, he told them, that he had it perfected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>A visit to the Perkins&rsquo;s wagon shed resulted in
the exhibition of a business-like looking sled, with
a wheel connected to the flexible steel runners
with which to steer. From each side of the contrivance,
a pair of canvas wings, spread over
stout frames, extended for a distance of about ten
feet. The frame was made as light as possible,
and Paul was confident the glider would work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Tubby, as they
stood regarding the odd looking contrivance,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a good full moon to-night. We&rsquo;ll slip
out of the village after supper and try it out on
Jones&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was agreed that this would furnish some
amusement and excitement. Soon the boys were
enthusiastically making their arrangements.
Paul said that he could detach the wings and so
carry the sled without exciting undue attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t know if it will work yet,&rdquo; the
young inventor confessed, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want to
be the laughing stock of the place in case a crowd
is on hand to see me take a tumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that,&rdquo; Merritt assured him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sneak round by the back way up through
Cryders Lane and then take that path through
the scrub oak to the top of the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Like so many conspirators the lads met at Paul
Perkins&rsquo;s after the evening meal, and each bearing
a portion of the load, they set out for the long,
steep grade down which the test was to be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard in the village to-night that Freeman
Hunt and his crowd have a big bob they are going
to enter for the cup race,&rdquo; said Tubby, as
they walked along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad there is no way of keeping them out.
They&rsquo;ll be sure to be up to something crooked,&rdquo;
commented Merritt. &ldquo;However, as it&rsquo;s free for
all, I suppose we can&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; rejoined Rob. &ldquo;By the way,
Paul, did you hear anything further from the
lawyer in Washington, since you received his
dispatch telling you that Hunt&rsquo;s message was,
just as I supposed, a forgery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that the outlook is very favorable,&rdquo; was
Paul&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;He says&mdash;it sounds like a
fairy tale,&rdquo; he interjected with a note of apology&mdash;&ldquo;he
said that if the government took it they
would give five thousand dollars for the exclusive
right to use the machine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; cried Rob. &ldquo;I guess that would set
our friend Hunt back a peg or two if he heard of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They met no one on their way to the hill, as
the night was chilly and they stuck to their little-frequented
route. The moonlight lit up the
steep descent and made it as bright as day almost,
throwing here and there sharp, black shadows on
the white snow. It was an ideal night for sledding
and the boys felt their pulses beat with excitement
as they adjusted the wings and prepared
the glider, of which so much was expected, for
its initial flight.</p>
<p>At last the wings were firmly bolted on, and
fixed in position with set screws. In addition,
piano wires leading to eyelets in the frame of the
sled, and which acted as wing-braces, were utilized.
When this was complete, each wing was
as rigid as steel, presenting a slightly curved
surface toward the front. They were, in fact,
closely modeled on the wings Paul&rsquo;s observant
eyes had noted on the army airship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, who is to have the honor of the
first flight on the greatest invention of the age?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Rob laughed as he gazed about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t all speak at once,&rdquo; said Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one can have my turn,&rdquo; ejaculated
Tubby, with deep conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m to be the first to try it, of course,&rdquo;
spoke up Paul, boldly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lightest, and anyhow,
an inventor ought not to risk anybody&rsquo;s
bones but his own on his freak ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we take it half way down the hill for
a starter,&rdquo; suggested Rob, &ldquo;then we can see if
it&rsquo;s going to work or tip over, without running
such a risk of a smash-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, the contrivance, looking like a
queer bird in the moonlight, was shoved down the
hill to a post about a quarter of a mile from the
bottom.</p>
<p>Paul seated his slight frame upon the craft,
bracing his feet against two projecting iron rests
and taking a firm grip of the steering wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right?&rdquo; asked Rob, as the others stood
behind, holding detaining hands upon the vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; ordered Paul, boldly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Like a stone from a sling, the sled shot off into
the cold, breathless night. On and on under the
stars it flew, its runners grating with a sharp,
musical note on the close-packed snow, for that
afternoon there had been a lot of sleighing on the
grade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t rise!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
like me. Built for a career close to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on. I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; exclaimed
Rob the next instant. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke a strange thing happened. The
sled seemed to rise from the earth as if drawn
upward by some invisible force. Even at that
distance they could see Paul&rsquo;s body shift as he
strove to maintain his balance on the contrivance.</p>
<p>Up and up the strange bird-like craft climbed,
till it was about ten feet above the ground. It
skimmed along for a hundred feet or so and then
came down to earth again with a bump that unseated
the inexperienced rider and sent him
tumbling head first into a snow bank. But, as
the others came running down the hill, Paul extricated
himself and gave a shrill cheer.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="caption">Up and up the strange bird-like craft climbed, till it was about ten feet above the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray, fellows! She works!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a success as a dumping machine, I&rsquo;ll admit,&rdquo;
sniffed Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait till I put some springs on to take
up the jolt when she lands and she&rsquo;ll settle like a
bit of thistledown,&rdquo; Paul assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t settle you first,&rdquo; put in Merritt,
rather doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody want a ride?&rdquo; asked Paul, as he prepared
to tow the craft back to the top of the hill
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t made my will yet and I can&rsquo;t
afford to risk the legal complications which might
ensue in case of my death,&rdquo; responded Tubby,
grandiloquently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decided what sort of stuff I&rsquo;ll have
them write on my tombstone,&rdquo; chimed in Merritt,
&ldquo;so you can count me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a blue funk. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo;
laughed Rob. &ldquo;If you want to take a chance
on having your machine smashed up I&rsquo;ll take her
down, Paul,&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray for the hero,&rdquo; scoffed Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adios,&rdquo; said Merritt, placing his hand over
his heart in an affected attitude, and using some
of the Spanish he had picked up in the West,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll gather up the remains to-morrow&mdash;ma&ntilde;ana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banana, you mean,&rdquo; chuckled Paul, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;ll
just be as easy as eating one for Rob to ride the
Pegasus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve christened it already, have you?&rdquo;
inquired Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only name I could think of,&rdquo; answered
Paul. &ldquo;Pegasus was a winged horse, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And poets have been riding the poor critter to
death ever since,&rdquo; chimed in Tubby, with a
snicker.</p>
<p>Rob decided that he would try his experimental
ride from the summit of the hill. From what he
had seen, it would be no very difficult task to control
the winged sled. He was, in fact, so anxious
to be off on his initial voyage that he could hardly
wait till they reached the summit of the moonlit
hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>At last, however, everything was ready for
the start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, Peggy!&rdquo; cautioned Tubby, as with
Merritt he hung on to the rear of the sled, while
Paul gave Rob some final instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Balance her just like you would a bicycle,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and when you feel her rising don&rsquo;t resist,
but just take it easy. Look out for the landing,
though. It&rsquo;ll jolt the wishbone out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to get a tumble,&rdquo; Rob assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he added the next minute,
straining his eyes to make sure the hill ahead
was clear.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was off, rushing through the
frosty air at an exhilarating clip. All at once
he felt a queer, rising movement, and knew that
the winged sled was starting to spread its pinions.
Far behind him he heard a faint cheer. Like a
bicycle rider, Rob balanced a tipping tendency in
either direction by swaying his body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whee-e-e-e-e-e-e!&rdquo; he yelled in sheer delight
at the wonderful sensation as he clove the atmosphere.
Above him the frosty stars twinkled. Beneath
was the long, white hill, chequered vividly
here and there with inky splashings of shadow.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just ahead as it seemed, and slightly
below him, there came a loud shout. Rob was
startled, and for an instant he allowed his attention
to waver. Like a flash the machine tilted,
and with the boy still clinging desperately to its
careening form, the Pegasus shot staggeringly
downward through the air, driving straight at
four dark forms that had just come into view at
the foot of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; was all Rob had time to yell before
the marvelous flying sled was ploughing at
top speed into their midst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;THERE&rsquo;S MANY A SLIP&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Look out where you&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a giant owl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and a dozen other exclamations of dismay
and alarm mingled with a great splintering,
and crashing, and snapping, as Rob came ploughing
down to earth. Luckily, he fetched up in a
snow bank, into which the velocity with which
the winged-sled had been traveling, drove it,
for three feet or more.</p>
<p>The wings were reduced to a mass of torn canvas
and shattered frames, while the steel-runners
were buckled and bent under the strain. A
more complete wreck was never seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>But havoc had been done, likewise, to the group
into which Rob had inadvertently plunged. As
it so happened, they were the last persons in the
world he would have wished to encounter just
then, for in the voices that rang out about him,
as the four figures were thrown right and left,
he had recognized the familiar tones of Freeman
Hunt, Bill Bender, Jack Curtiss and Lem
Lonsdale. They had, by a strange coincidence,
selected the same night upon which Paul&rsquo;s friends
had come to try out their big sleigh with which
they intended to capture the silver cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody hurt?&rdquo; hailed Rob, as he extricated
himself from the snow-pile, feeling a little dizzy
by the rapidity with which his smash-up had occurred.
At one moment he was flying, and the
next he was ignominiously toppled into a snow
bank, with the splintered wreck of his winged
vehicle about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody hurt?&rdquo; he repeated, coming toward
the group, the members of which were brushing
off the snow that had clung to them when they
were shot here and there by the lad&rsquo;s sudden
descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that cub Blake,&rdquo; whispered Hunt to Jack
Curtiss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; growled Jack in a low
voice. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t scared of him or a dozen like
him. Hurt?&rdquo; he went on at the top of his voice.
&ldquo;No, we ain&rsquo;t, but I suppose you&rsquo;d like to have
seen us all injured for life by that fool thing you
were flopping about on. You&rsquo;re a great inventor&mdash;not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my invention,&rdquo; said Rob, with meaning
emphasis. &ldquo;It was the idea of a friend of mine&mdash;a
young fellow who made something else that
interested a certain man in this town so much
that he tried to forge a telegram to get a chance
to buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you aiming at me?&rdquo; demanded Freeman
Hunt, coming forward, &ldquo;or at my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the cap fits, you can wear it,&rdquo; retorted Rob,
thoroughly angry with Hunt and his companions.
He was turning contemptuously away when Jack
Curtiss stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there a minute, young fellow,&rdquo; he
snarled, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a lesson coming to you, and
right here is as good a place as any to give it
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;The same sort of lesson you tried to give me
in the road one night, eh?&rdquo; flung back Rob, scornfully;
&ldquo;the same sort of lesson that the fellow
who fired that gun at me in the wood wanted to
give me, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an accident. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt
you,&rdquo; blurted out Freeman Hunt, before his wiser
cronies could stop him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my guess was right. It was you that
fired it,&rdquo; said Rob. &ldquo;Thanks for giving me the
proof of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother it all, he&rsquo;s got a hold over us now,&rdquo;
muttered Jack Curtiss, turning away as Rob&rsquo;s
chums came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the smash-up happened,&rdquo; said Rob to
Paul. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Paul. I couldn&rsquo;t help
it, though. Something seemed to divert my attention
for a second, and the next thing I knew
I was head-over-heels in the snow-pile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing it was there,&rdquo; said Merritt, who,
with the others, had been examining the wreck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what a big hole his head made,&rdquo; cried
Tubby, pointing to the hole in the soft snow
where Rob had driven into it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it all right with you, Paul,&rdquo; Rob
promised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that you are able to build a
bigger, better flyer than this one. I believe that
if we don&rsquo;t break our necks trying it out, that you
have a good idea there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; asked Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; rejoined Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He really does,&rdquo; sneered Jack Curtiss from
the patch of shadow in which he and his cronies
were standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d broken your skull instead of
hitting that snow bank,&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; said Rob, serenely; &ldquo;unfortunately
for you, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you think you are going to get that
cup at the sled carnival, don&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; chuckled Bill
Bender; &ldquo;well, you haven&rsquo;t got a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re on earth,&rdquo;
chimed in Lem Lonsdale, viciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, fellows,&rdquo; urged Freeman Hunt,
who had his own reasons for not wishing to
linger, &ldquo;leave the babies alone. They&rsquo;ve smashed
their pretty toy, now let them run home to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>So saying, he turned, and began lugging the
long, racy-looking toboggan they had brought
with them up the steep, white hill. With a muttered
threat about punching heads and &ldquo;fresh
young cubs,&rdquo; Jack Curtiss and the others followed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;d better pick up the remains
and go home,&rdquo; said Tubby, dragging out a splintered
wing-tip from the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s wait here
and see what those fellows can do. I guess
they&rsquo;ve come out here to try that big, new sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, a few seconds later there came a
loud screech from the top of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; volunteered Tubby, bending
forward.</p>
<p>High up the hill, outlined sharply against the
snow, there came rushing toward them a flying
object. It seemed to fairly whiz over the frozen
surface. Hardly had they sighted it before it
flashed past with yells of defiance from its occupants,
and vanished into the darkness cast by a
clump of big fir trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got a flyer;
no mistake about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be faster yet when they get those runners
rubbed down,&rdquo; vouchsafed Merritt; &ldquo;it only came
in this afternoon from New York. They got it
from a big sporting-goods house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the same one Jack got his flying machine
from,&rdquo; chuckled Paul, smiling over the remembrance
of the bully&rsquo;s discomfiture on the occasion
of the aeroplane model contest, as told
in the first volume of this series.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; responded Tubby, in reply
to Paul&rsquo;s observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they get the money from?&rdquo; wondered
Merritt. &ldquo;That sled must have cost a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Hunt&rsquo;s father gives him plenty of money,&rdquo;
was Rob&rsquo;s response, &ldquo;and the others are not
exactly poor. They could easily afford such a
sled for the gratification of winning the cup
away from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s about all they&rsquo;ve gone into the
competition for,&rdquo; suggested Paul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The others agreed with him. It would be a
big feather in the caps of the arch enemies of
the Boy Scouts if they could capture any of the
events which were to take place on the hill after
Christmas, especially the big cup event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us to look out for any crooked work,
then,&rdquo; said Tubby, as, with arms full of such
parts of the shattered Pegasus as seemed worth
keeping, they started for home. &ldquo;Those fellows
won&rsquo;t stick at anything as we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be too hard on them,&rdquo; was Rob&rsquo;s
comment; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s good in most chaps if you look
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; sniffed Merritt, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have to go
prospecting with a pickaxe and dynamite to find
it in Jack Curtiss&rsquo; crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then use a microscope,&rdquo; commented
Tubby, in spite of Rob&rsquo;s protests that they ought
to use &ldquo;fair play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>As Rob had prophesied, Paul managed to build
a new winged-sled, and despite an occasional
flop, it proved to be a handy sort of contrivance,
making short glides and alighting on its
spring runners without more than almost dislocating
the rider&rsquo;s vertebrae. However, boy-like,
the lads of Hampton regarded it as a wonderful
invention, and lauded it to the skies, so
much so, that a paragraph concerning &ldquo;our ingenious
young fellow townsman, Paul Perkins,&rdquo;
was inserted in an issue of the <i>Hampton Local</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that make you sick,&rdquo; sneered Jack
Curtiss, when he saw the item. &ldquo;Ingenious indeed&mdash;anybody
could do things like that if they
had a mind to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this saying, Jack came as near to the truth
as in anything he had uttered for a long time.</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo;s Hill became alive now in the gloaming,
and on moonlight nights, with sleds of all descriptions,
from small, old-fashioned &ldquo;foot-steerers&rdquo; to
the big, polished, nickel-trimmed, flexible-guiding
store varieties. One thing the trials had shown,
on comparison with previous records, and this
was that the capture of the silver cup probably
lay between the big toboggan of the Curtiss faction,
and the six-seater manipulated by Rob and
his chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;If there is no dark horse entered, Hampton
gets the cup this year sure,&rdquo; Rob declared one
evening as the happy, tired boys began to retrace
their steps to the village, after an evening
of exciting practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see much satisfaction in that if Curtiss
and his crowd win it,&rdquo; mumbled Tubby,
which brought down upon his head another lecture
from Rob, who, as should all good scouts,
did not believe in harboring a grudge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the best team win,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all we
ask for&mdash;that, and fair play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the evening of which we have spoken, Paul
and his chums met at his house to discuss final
plans for the race and talk over the advisability
of showing off the paces of the winged-sled. In
the midst of their talk, Rob got up from the table
and started for the door with a plate containing
sundry apple cores, the remains of the fruit which
the deliberators had consumed as an aid to their
counsels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>He had opened the portal and was about to
chuck them out into the night when he suddenly
paused and stood listening sharply. He thought&mdash;was
sure, in fact&mdash;that he had heard a furtive
footstep creep away from the house as he flung
the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut that door for goodness sake,&rdquo; howled
Tubby, as Rob stood there peering out; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
freezing us to death in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others added their voices of protest. Thus
admonished, Rob closed the door, and returned
to the table. Although he said nothing about it,
he could not get out of his head the idea that he
had seen a form, darker than the surrounding
blackness, slip away from the house as he gazed
forth.</p>
<p>It was not far from midnight when the boyish
conference broke up, and Rob, Tubby and
Merritt started for their homes, which lay in
the same direction. They had reached Tubby&rsquo;s
house and were just saying good-night when
there came a sudden alarming shout. On the
frosty air it rang out, as clearly and as startlingly
as a midnight bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FIRE!</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There it is, down there!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby,
pointing back toward the part of the village they
had just left.</p>
<p>A red, flickering glare was already illuminating
the sky in that part of the place. Clearly it
was the fire. As they gazed, other shouts were
added to the first outcry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; shouted Rob, starting off at top
speed in that direction. But as he set off another
idea occurred to him. The firehouse was not
far from Tubby&rsquo;s house&mdash;on the next block, in
fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows go ahead!&rdquo; shouted Rob, turning.
He dashed off toward the firehouse in which the
old-fashioned hand pump engine was kept. On
top of the place was a big bell, the rope of which
hung down in front of the building. Rob seized
it as he arrived at the place, and started a wild
clamor ringing out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will rouse out the Boy Scouts,&rdquo; he muttered;
&ldquo;they all know what to do when they hear
the fire bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was right. Hardly had the echoes
of the tocsin died out before from dozens of
houses boyish figures came pouring. Boy Scouts
every one of them, and ready for active duty.
Little Andy, the Eagles&rsquo; bugler, went tearing past
as Rob dropped the bell rope, satisfied that the
alarm had been well-sounded. He was racing
on when Rob seized him by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound the assembly!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>Andy, considerably startled at first, quickly
recovered himself, and placed the bugle to his
lips. The sibilant call was soon sounding. In
less than five minutes the Boy Scouts had obediently
gathered at the firehouse, and, under Rob&rsquo;s
directions, were falling in to await orders. Dale
Harding was there, too, with the Hawks, and the
two patrols eagerly hung on the next word of
command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Down the street came Boffy Groggs, the janitor
of the firehouse. He was half asleep and
was regarding the key he carried in his hand as
if he hardly knew what to do with it. The volunteer
firemen of the village had not yet put in an
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting on their fancy uniforms,&rdquo; guessed
Rob, as Boffy came mooning along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Boffy, give me that!&rdquo; shouted Rob, as
he saw the key in the sleepy old man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire in your hat?&rdquo; inquired old Boffy, who
was somewhat deaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, give me that!&rdquo; snapped Rob. &ldquo;Quick,
there&rsquo;s no time to lose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got on my shoes, and that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo;
grunted Boffy, comprehendingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back
and put them on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was actually starting back when Rob
seized the key from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Hey!&rdquo; shouted Boffy, indignant at being
robbed of his authority, as he deemed it,
&ldquo;give that back, Rob Blake, you&rsquo;ve got no right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;To be wasting time here,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, impatiently,
and hastily opening the firehouse door;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s true enough, Boffy&mdash;Hullo, Tubby,
where is the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s at Paul Perkins&rsquo;s,&rdquo; exclaimed the fat
boy, who had just come racing up; &ldquo;the wagon
house&mdash;poof&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, all out of breath, and gasped like
a newly-landed fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with the engine, boys, and race her down
to Paul Perkins&rsquo;s place!&rdquo; ordered Rob, not waiting
to hear the rest.</p>
<p>With a shout the Boy Scouts swept into the engine
house, and soon were tailing onto the long
ropes by which the engine was dragged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward! Double quick!&rdquo; came the next order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here!&rdquo; shouted Boffy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to the fire. Out of the way,
Boffy!&rdquo; yelled the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for hire! Bring it back!&rdquo; shouted the
hard-of-hearing janitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; roared Rob and Dale Harding
in a breath.</p>
<p>Instantly the wheels began to revolve, and
the ponderous machine came trundling out of the
shed, and an instant later was being raced down
the street, drawn by strong, young arms. Cheering
like soldiers, the Boy Scouts dashed along.
Old Boffy sprang back as the big machine crashed
past him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back! Come back!&rdquo; he yelled, as it
vanished in the distance.</p>
<p>As Tubby had reported, it was the wagon
house which was on fire. As the Boy Scouts
came racing up with the engine, yellow flames
were licking hungrily at its eastern end. A red
glow spread all about, and the air was filled with
the sharp, acrid smell of blazing wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you, and you, and you,&rdquo; ordered Rob,
singling out three lads, &ldquo;take that hose down to
the brook. The rest of you tail on to the hand-brakes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>In an instant the lads ordered to carry the hose
to the creek were off, and it was not more than
five minutes before the pumps began to suck.
Presently, from the clanking apparatus, there
began to pour a feeble stream. It strengthened
as the engine got limbered up and soon quite a
force of water was spurting upon the flames.
They hissed and set up clouds of steam as the
cold water struck them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; shouted the boys at the brakes, but
their leaders quickly silenced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your wind to work the pumps,&rdquo; ordered
Dale Harding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The machine! The machine!&rdquo; cried a voice,
and Paul Perkins, pale and blackened with soot
and flying embers, came dashing in among them.
The lad&rsquo;s hands were cut and bleeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to drag it out by myself, but I
couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he explained to Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott, I forgot all about that,&rdquo; exclaimed
Rob. &ldquo;Come on, fellows, let&rsquo;s get Paul&rsquo;s
machine out of there. I guess we can save it
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>It looked doubtful, however, if this could be
accomplished. The flames now were leaping savagely
up, but as yet they were confined to one end
of the building. The wind, though, was driving
them angrily forward, devouring the old dried
timbers with the greed of a ferocious monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open those doors!&rdquo; shouted Rob, and the next
instant the big wooden bar had fallen from the
portals as Paul unlocked the stout padlock holding
them. As they swung open, the boys could
see the machine standing in the centre of the
place, illumined with a red glare. The heat that
drove out was as intense as if they had opened the
doors of a bake oven, but they didn&rsquo;t flinch. Led
by Rob and Dale Harding, they plunged into the
fiery place. The heat seemed as if it would split
their skins and singe their hair, but they paid
little attention to it in the excitement of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay hold of those runners, boys,&rdquo; cried Dale,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll drag her out that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good scheme,&rdquo; panted Rob, bending over and
seizing hold. But the machine was heavy and
refused to budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a rope,&rdquo; suggested Merritt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;No time to get it,&rdquo; panted Rob; &ldquo;come on, try
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They strained till their muscles cracked, and
this time the bulky contrivance slipped forward
a little. Working with might and main, they had
almost succeeded in getting it to a place of safety
when there was a sudden shout from Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gasolene. That tank&rsquo;s full of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott, it will blow up!&rdquo; cried Dale
Harding.</p>
<p>As he spoke a cloud of sparks and hissing embers
flew about them, driven from the burning
end of the barn by a puff of wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quit!&rdquo; urged Rob, as they hesitated;
&ldquo;no Boy Scout ever quits. We&rsquo;ve tackled this
job; let&rsquo;s see it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words put heart into the somewhat scared
boys, and once more they bent their efforts to
dragging out the machine. This time they managed
to run it fairly beyond the danger line, and
it was as well that they did so at that moment,
for the feeble stream thrown by the hand-engine
had had little effect on the flames, and by now
one entire end of the wagon house had been
burned away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>By this time, also, a big crowd had gathered,
and as Rob and his companions, scorched and
singed, stood triumphantly by the side of the machine
they had rescued, they could hear angry
shouts and the sounds of an argument coming
from the direction of the engine. Elbowing their
way through the throng, many members of
which sought to detain and congratulate them,
the lads found that the regular firemen had arrived
and were attempting to wrest the hand-brakes
from the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>The boys were, somewhat naturally, protesting.
Just as Rob and his friends came up, one
big, hulking fellow laid hands on little Joe Digby
and was about to hurl him backward out of the
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young monkey!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;you kids
had no business to steal our engine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing they did,&rdquo; howled the crowd. &ldquo;If
they hadn&rsquo;t the whole village might have been
burned by the time you fellows got on your uniforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right at a firemen&rsquo;s picnic, but no
good at a fire,&rdquo; shouted someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ray for the Boy Scouts,&rdquo; came another cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; roared the exasperated firemen,
reddening under their shiny helmets, all glistening
with paint and decorations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, this has got to stop,&rdquo; said Rob, stepping
forward. &ldquo;Scouts, let go of the engine. We&rsquo;ve
done our part of the work; now let them get
busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Rob,&rdquo; came his father&rsquo;s voice
out of the crowd; &ldquo;while they were arguing the
fire was burning. Work those pumps, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ray!&rdquo; yelled the crowd again, as the firemen
began to pump strenuously.</p>
<p>The machine clanked and rattled like a thresher,
and a great stream of water poured forth, but,
unfortunately it had no effect upon the blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house! The house!&rdquo; came a sudden cry
in a woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Sparks are falling on the
roof. It&rsquo;ll be on fire in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>It was Mrs. Perkins. With her hair in curl
papers and a wonderful flannel nightgown on,
she stood in the back door of her home and yelled
this warning. At any other time the boys might
have felt inclined to laugh. The situation now
was too serious for that, however. As she spoke,
a perfect hail of sparks were being driven upon
the shingled roof. It was dry and old, and was
already beginning to smolder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that ladder,&rdquo; shouted Merritt, whose
sharp eyes had spied one leaning against an old
tree some distance from the house. In an instant
a dozen pairs of Boy Scout hands had carried it
to the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run her up, boys, and get all the buckets you
can,&rdquo; ordered Rob, as the ladder was placed in
position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Calling Dale Harding, Merritt and Tubby, the
boy sprang up toward the roof. Behind him,
upon the ladder, stood the others. They had
guessed his purpose&mdash;to form a bucket line from
the pump to the roof. With Hiram at the pump
handle, and plenty of willing volunteers to relieve
him when he tired, buckets and tin pails of water
were soon passing rapidly along the line and being
splashed over the roof. As fast as Rob got
one section wetted, he passed on to another, till
the whole covering of the house was drenched,
and there was no danger of the place catching.</p>
<p>By this time, the wonderful motor-scooter had,
too, been dragged beyond the reach of the flames,
and although the wagon house was speedily reduced
to a heap of glowing embers, the invention,
for which Freeman Hunt and his father had
striven so desperately, was safe. As the crowd
saw that the excitement was over, it began to
break up and melt away, till only a few persons
were left about the ruins.</p>
<p>Among these lingerers were Stonington Hunt
and his worthy son. The elder of the two seemed
to be in a great rage. He gritted his teeth as
he gazed at the Boy Scouts clustering about
Paul&rsquo;s machine, and spoke to his offspring in a
low voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;Luck seems to have turned against me of
late,&rdquo; he muttered, savagely; &ldquo;another failure.
But either I&rsquo;ll have that machine or no one else
shall, or my name&rsquo;s not Stonington Hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started the fire at the wrong end of the
wagon house, pop,&rdquo; rejoined his son, in a low
voice, but low as his tones were, his father seemed
seized with alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, Freeman,&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely,
looking about him in a scared sort of way. &ldquo;Remember
we know nothing about the fire. We
were in bed when it started, and raced down here
to find out what terrible calamity threatened our
fair village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman Hunt nodded comprehendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, pop; mum&rsquo;s the word,&rdquo; he breathed,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those brats are not through with me yet by a
good sight,&rdquo; rejoined his father, vindictively, by
way of reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor with me,&rdquo; chimed in Freeman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Soon after this worthy pair left the place,
having been unnoticed by Rob or any of his
chums or scouts. It was Tubby who, poking
about the ruins after his usual inquisitive fashion,
made a sudden discovery, a short time later. He
had come across a piece of wood which was unburned,
having been thrown aside by Paul Perkins
in his first efforts to quell the fire.</p>
<p>The boy sniffed this bit of wood curiously and
then summoned his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smell that,&rdquo; he demanded of them in turn.</p>
<p>Each lad took a sniff of the proffered bit of
wood and passed it on to the next in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; interrogated Tubby, after it passed a
dozen hands, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kerosene,&rdquo; was the unanimous answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; rejoined Rob; &ldquo;fellows, it&rsquo;s up
to the Boy Scouts to find out who set fire to Paul
Perkins&rsquo;s wagon house, and tried to destroy his
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this will help us do it,&rdquo; suggested Tubby,
meditatively. As he spoke he extended the
oil-soaked fragment into the glare of a lantern
hanging from the fire engine. On it they could
then see distinctly was the impress of a man&rsquo;s
thumb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of robbers and bad men being detected
through just such imprints,&rdquo; declared Rob;
&ldquo;may be it will work in this case. They say no
two men&rsquo;s thumb prints are alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so, we&rsquo;d better start out making a
collection,&rdquo; suggested Tubby, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got an
idea that there is one man in this town whose
imprint would be of interest in that connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; queried a dozen eager Boy Scout
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man in the moon,&rdquo; laughed the fat youth,
pocketing the fragment of wood. But it was to
be a long time before he had an opportunity to
use it to confirm his suspicions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, the sea wot flows;</p>
<p class="t0"><i>And</i> the ship wot goes,</p>
<p class="t"><i>And</i> the lad wot fears no dan-ger;</p>

<p class="t"><i>And</i> the lass wot loves a sail-or-r-r-!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there, lad!&rdquo; exclaimed the singer, bluff
old Captain Hudgins, &ldquo;bringing up all standing,&rdquo;
as he would have expressed it, in front of Rob
Blake&rsquo;s home on the morning of the Bob-sled
Carnival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time are them sliding craft due to slip
their moorings on Jones&rsquo;s Hill?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hullo, cap,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, hastening
down the snowy path to meet his old friend from
Topsail Island. &ldquo;I thought I knew that song.
The races start this afternoon, but owing to the
number of entries the committee has decided to
continue them to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ter-night!&rdquo; exclaimed the ancient mariner,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; ter come sky-hootin&rsquo; down that
hill in the black night, boy? Stand by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the black night, exactly,&rdquo; laughed
Rob, amused at the old man&rsquo;s bewilderment; &ldquo;you
see, this was decided on some days ago, and
they&rsquo;ve got incandescents rigged up on both sides
of the course. It&rsquo;s going to be a pretty sight,
and there&rsquo;ll be a big crowd out to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll have to stay over then,&rdquo; snorted
the captain. &ldquo;When I was a boy we thought
bob-sledding was good enough, without havin&rsquo;
races atween port and starboard craft, with patent
steerers, and more opportunities to break your
neck than you can shake a stick at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not as bad as that,&rdquo; Rob assured him.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe enough if the fellows are careful, and
they all are, and besides that, they all know how
to handle a big sled, and that&rsquo;s a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon so,&rdquo; agreed the captain. &ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ve
got to trim my sails and get afore the wind. I&rsquo;m
setting my course for the post office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going that way, too,&rdquo; said Rob; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they set off up the street, which was
filled with men and boys, all discussing the forthcoming
bob-sled races. The regular population
of Hampton was already augmented by rooters
from other towns, and the afternoon trains would
bring in more. In front of the post office Rob
met Tubby Hopkins, Merritt Crawford, Paul Perkins
and Hiram Nelson. They were to form the
team of the &ldquo;Eagle,&rdquo; as the Boy Scout&rsquo;s sled had
been named.</p>
<p>Several other boys had their tobogganing sleds
in front of the post office, which appeared to be
quite a gathering place for the prospective contestants.
Among them were Jack Curtiss and
his team. The former bully of the Hampton
Academy sneered as the boys came up, but made
no other sign of hostility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; was painted a bright red with gilt
trimmings, and looked very handsome. Several
in the crowd were making admiring comments on
her as Rob approached. Jack Curtiss&rsquo; sled, too,
came in for a lot of attention. It fairly glistened
with paint and varnish, and being a store-made
affair was naturally better finished off than the
Boy Scouts&rsquo; craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curtiss and his bunch will win the cup, hands
down,&rdquo; a man was saying, as the Boy Scouts
moved off on their way to the hill, where already
several boys were practicing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much doubt of it,&rdquo; was the response;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve sure got a fine sled there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, young feller, want to bet on yer team?&rdquo;
cried the first speaker after Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t bet, thank you,&rdquo; was the response;
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve got as good a chance of winning as
the next fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that jar you?&rdquo; muttered the
man, as the crowd broke into a laugh at Rob&rsquo;s
retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to bet all your money on us,&rdquo; said
Freeman Hunt, and he and his cronies prepared
to follow Rob and his chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re going to win. There&rsquo;s no
doubt of it,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you seem mighty positive about it,&rdquo;
commented the man.</p>
<p>Workmen were busy on either side of the hill
stringing up electric lights, as the boys arrived.
Between the rows of tall poles crowds of lads
were scooting down the hill on their sleds, or
laboriously hauling them up again. It was an
animated scene, and there were plenty of lookers-on
as the racing sleds glided swiftly over the
smooth surface. It had been watered and packed
till it was as hard and smooth as a sheet of glass.
It glistened in the winter sun like polished steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Won&rsquo;t we whiz over that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Merritt, as they hastened to ascend the
hill by a path left at one side of the course. Arrived
at the top, an examination of the runners
of the sled followed. They were found to be as
smooth as a mirror, which is an important thing,
for the slightest roughness will check a sled&rsquo;s
speed more than would be thought possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason I think we may have a
chance over Curtiss and his bunch,&rdquo; explained
Rob, as they took their seats for a trial trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Tubby, who, on account
of his weight, sat in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, their runners have hardly had time to
wear smooth yet,&rdquo; went on Rob. &ldquo;You know it
takes a long time to get them into good shape.
We wore ours down last year, before we lightened
the sled and widened it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; shouted Merritt, from his seat in
front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>The next instant they were off. How that
sled flew down the smooth hill! The frosty air
whipped tinglingly back against their happy
faces. The runners screamed as they rushed over
the hard snow. Small boys cheered as they shot
by. Everybody knew that the &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; was one of
the favorites in the big event&mdash;the race for the
silver cup.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fast,&rdquo; grudgingly admitted Jack Curtiss,
as the red sled flew by him on its way down
the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can clip a nailparing of a second off
her,&rdquo; rejoined Freeman Hunt, boastfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; inquired Lem Lonsdale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; chimed in Bill Bender, confidently.</p>
<p>Both Bill and Jack had been betting pretty
freely on their success, and both felt certain that
they would win. But a momentary look of
anxiety had crossed their faces as Rob and his
chums flew by. There was no denying that their
pace was tremendous. The Aquebogue team,
which had arrived on an early train, followed
the &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; down the hill, but did not seem to
make such good time. Still, it was possible that,
as defenders of the cup, they were not showing
all they could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can beat them with a ton of hay tied on
behind,&rdquo; sneered Jack Curtiss, as he watched the
Aquebogue Wolves make their practice trips. His
words seemed justified by the speed their own
sled made. Like a varnished streak, she shot
down the hill again and again, each time wearing
her runners smoother and making better
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>And so the morning wore away. The afternoon
was devoted to the small races, Ernest
Thompson and Joe Digby, of the Eagles, winning
two prizes to their great delight. Some of the
Hawk boys, too, captured events. But the feature
of the afternoon was Paul Perkins&rsquo;s winged sled,
which cavorted and flopped about to the huge delight
of the crowd, and to the terror of the
lad&rsquo;s mother, who was among the onlookers. At
four o&rsquo;clock the minor events were all over and
there only remained the silver cup to be contested
for.</p>
<p>The Aquebogue Wolves, all strapping youths,
considerably older than the Hampton boys, strode
about the town confidently during the evening,
although the talk of the Hamptonites must have
disturbed them a little. The teams from the other
contesting towns also talked big, but that seemed
to be more to keep up appearances than anything
else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, the time seems as if it would never
pass,&rdquo; said Tubby, as after supper the lads hastened
back to the hill. The electric lights were
glowing now, casting a yellow radiance over the
snow. Few people were on hand as yet, however,
as the race was not to start till eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The few that were on hand were warmly muffled
up in furs and heavy overcoats. Of course,
there were plenty of small boys about, playing all
manner of tricks on one another to keep warm,
and hurling snowballs at persons they deemed
good-natured enough not to resent it&mdash;and at
others, too. What boy doesn&rsquo;t enjoy &ldquo;a chase&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The sleds which were to take part in the race
were lined up in readiness near the starting point.
While the crews had been at supper various persons
had been left in charge of the sleds. Rob
and his chums had found a youth, who was quite
a character in the village, to take care of theirs.
This lad&rsquo;s name was Sim Bimm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Whether it was caused by his name&mdash;which
rhymed, or by natural gift that way, nobody
knew, but Sim Bimm had difficulty in saying anything
in prose. On the contrary, rhyming
marked his conversation. He was reputed to be
half-witted, but in some things he was shrewd
enough. For lack of a better guardian the boys
had singled Sim Bimm out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sim,&rdquo; Rob had said impressively,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a dollar coming to you if you watch
our sled carefully. Don&rsquo;t let anyone come near
it or touch it in any way. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right and true, I&rsquo;ll watch for you,&rdquo; responded
Sim, giving vent to his peculiar mode of expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what excuse they give don&rsquo;t let
them lay hands on the sled, Sim,&rdquo; added Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a foot nor a hand, be they ever so grand,&rdquo;
Sim assured the boys, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Sim,&rdquo; said Tubby, as they moved
off; &ldquo;we trust you, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right Sim to trust; I&rsquo;ll watch till I
bust,&rdquo; rejoined the rhyming youth.</p>
<p>Hardly had the lads vanished down the hill,
however, before Sim, who in order to watch more
closely, was seated right upon the sleigh, saw
two figures approaching him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes William Bender, and Jack Curtiss
so slender,&rdquo; improvised Sim as they drew closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sim,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, with great appearance
of cordiality, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watching this sled, with heart and head,&rdquo;
was the response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed Jack, &ldquo;at your rhyming
again, eh, Sam? Want to earn a little money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care for money; now isn&rsquo;t that funny?&rdquo;
firmly replied Sim, taking a grip on the sled with
both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you like candy, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! Mo-lasses candy; wish I had some
handy,&rdquo; wavered Sim, his mouth beginning to
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll go a little errand for me I&rsquo;ll
give you fifty cents to buy some with,&rdquo; Jack promised,
taking out a fifty-cent piece and extending
it temptingly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll watch the sled while you&rsquo;re
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to go; that&rsquo;s one thing I know,&rdquo;
said Sim; but there was a sort of undecided
quaver in his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; whispered Bill. Jack nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very far,&rdquo; the enemy of the Boy
Scouts went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just to get my gloves. I
dropped them at the foot of the hill. You can
be there and back in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go like the wind, be back quickly, you&rsquo;ll
find,&rdquo; promised Sim, rising to his feet. The
thought of molasses candy had proven too much
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; be off. We&rsquo;ll wait for you
here to take care of the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a dollar and a half, I&rsquo;ll sing and I&rsquo;ll
laugh,&rdquo; chuckled Sim to himself as he dashed
off, going as fast as his long legs would carry
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack as he vanished.
Reaching into his pocket he drew out a file, and
while Bill Bender raised the Boy Scouts&rsquo; sled he
rapidly filed the runners till they were as rough
as newly-molded metal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that will fix them,&rdquo; he said, as Sim
came panting back to announce that he could find
no gloves. But as both Jack and Bill Bender had
known all along that there were no gloves there,
this information didn&rsquo;t seem to interest them as
much as Sim had expected when he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked low and high, but no gloves could I
spy.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GREAT RACE.</span></h2>
<p>Ten minutes before the race was to start, the
hill, so bare and unpeopled when the boys climbed
it after supper, was alive with a gay throng.
Some carried horns which they blew loudly, the
harsh notes ringing out and adding to the clamor
of tongues. At the starting place a big crowd
was gathered, but the densest throng was assembled
about the finishing point. Excitement
was at a high pitch. The silver cup, for which
the race was to be run, had been on exhibition
all day in the window of the town jeweler, and
had excited great admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do hope our Wolf boys keep it,&rdquo; said a
pretty girl from Aquebogue, as she passed, on
the arm of her escort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Men and women from other towns were as
eager for their champions to win. Every face
shone with anticipation of the coming struggle.
At the finish line several photographers,
sent to the place by New York papers and periodicals,
had their flashlight apparatuses ready to
take pictures of the finish. Others stood at the
starting point, holding aloft their powder-filled
metal troughs and clicking the triggers which
would ignite the flashes, impatiently.</p>
<p>About a hundred yards back from the starting
line an anxious group was gathered. Rob, Merritt
and the others had just made a final inspection
and discovered the mischief that had been
done to their sleigh. It seemed hopeless to remedy
the damage, for it was manifestly impossible
to fit new runners, and only in that way could
they hope to be in a condition to compete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who was mean enough to do such a
thing,&rdquo; wondered Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marks of a file are as plain as day,&rdquo; exclaimed
Merritt, angrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Jack Curtiss or some of his crowd put
up this job,&rdquo; grated out Tubby, angrily, gazing
toward the bully and his companions, who were
dragging their shining, glittering sled to the
starting mark through an admiring crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you, Sim,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, in what was
for him a sharp, angry tone, &ldquo;did anyone come
around the sled while we were gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one I could see, not even a flea,&rdquo; rejoined
Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother your rhymes. Answer my question.
Did you see anyone here, or did you leave
the sled while we were gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell a fib; leave it I did,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did, eh, and after promising to watch
it, too,&rdquo; said Merritt angrily. &ldquo;What do you
mean by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his fist menacingly under Sim&rsquo;s pug
nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scare him or you won&rsquo;t get a word out
of him,&rdquo; warned Rob, coming forward from the
sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was with it while you left it, Sim?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;Until I came back I left it with Jack,&rdquo; responded
the shamefaced Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, just as I thought, fellows,&rdquo; said Rob,
turning to his companions; &ldquo;this was a put-up
job. Anyone with Jack?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His chum Bill Bender, with him did defend
her,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defend her. Did her all the damage they
could, I guess you mean,&rdquo; sputtered Tubby.
&ldquo;Hark, fellows! There goes the starting bugle.
It&rsquo;s all off,&rdquo; he concluded with a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not, yet, we&rsquo;ve got three minutes,&rdquo; replied
Rob, bravely, although he felt his spirits sink to
the lowest ebb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, you fellows, what&rsquo;s the matter? Looks
as if you&rsquo;d dropped a dollar and picked up a
dime,&rdquo; came a cheery voice behind them. They
turned and saw a tall, sun-burned young fellow
regarding them quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some rascals have roughened our runners
with a file and we can&rsquo;t compete,&rdquo; was Rob&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tough luck,&rdquo; sympathized the other; &ldquo;we
can&rsquo;t either. I&rsquo;m captain of the East Willetson
team, you know. Two of our men missed their
train and can&rsquo;t get here, so we are out of the
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not going to use your sled?&rdquo;
questioned Rob, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Hard luck, ain&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s a new one,
too&mdash;a dandy. I think it would beat any of
these I see here. However, it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was moving off, when Rob seized him. The
lad began to speak hurriedly, his words tumbling
out one after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, old man, I don&rsquo;t know your name, but
mine is Rob Blake. We had a good chance to
win this race if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that bit of foul
play. I wonder if we couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Borrow our sled?&rdquo; shot out the other, guessing
the boy&rsquo;s request before he had uttered it.
&ldquo;Sure you can, if the judges won&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask them,&rdquo; panted Rob, slipping off in the
crowd. In a minute he was back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say they don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he panted; &ldquo;where
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right back here. Hurry up; there goes the
line-up call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clear, sharp notes of a bugle rang out,
and men and boys began to hurry from all directions.
Suddenly there came a disturbance in the
crowd. Voices shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make way there! Give them room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the crowd came shoving the Eagle
boys, carrying the borrowed sled. In their green
and black sweaters, green knitted sleighing caps
and khaki trousers they were recognized as contestants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; shouted the crowd, quick to scent
a sensational happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the trouble back there?&rdquo; asked
Jack, in a low voice, of Bill Bender, as they prepared
to board their sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Seems to be a lot of excitement.
Great Hookey, it&rsquo;s those kids!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Look for yourself. They&rsquo;ve got another
sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickens they have! I&rsquo;ll protest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better not talk too much. Somebody might
know something and squeal, like they did at the
aeroplane model race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if they&rsquo;d overreached us,&rdquo; grumbled
Freeman Hunt, who, like Lem Lonsdale, was in
the secret of Jack Curtiss&rsquo; mean trick.</p>
<p>The race was to be run off in heats, on account
of the number of contestants. As Jack and his
chums were in the first heat, there was no time
for more to be said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; cried the starter. Then, as the boys
nodded, his pistol cracked, and off darted the
gliders, flashing down the hill like so many
streaks of brilliant color. Under the bright rays
of the suspended electric lights they made a pretty
sight, and so the crowd thought, for it cheered
them to the echo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Three heats were run off, and for the finals
there lined up the three winners of the preliminary
contests. These were the yellow and black
Aquebogue Wolves, the holders of the cup, Jack
Curtiss&rsquo; crew, and the Eagle men on their borrowed
sled. Jack had started to make a feeble
protest against the loaned sled being entered, but
the judges had frowned him down. Afraid that
they might have some inkling of who had filed
the runners of the &ldquo;Eagle,&rdquo; he dared not say
more.</p>
<p>The East Willetsons&rsquo; sled proved to be all that
its owners had claimed for it. It had captured
its heat with ease, shooting across the line a
good two feet in front of the nearest competitor.
The boys&rsquo; hearts beat high with hope and excitement.
It seemed that there was a chance of their
capturing the coveted cup, after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, boys, clap on all sail and come
windjamming inter port ahead of the rest of
them snow cruisers, or I won&rsquo;t never speak to
you again,&rdquo; came the voice of Captain Jeb Hudgins
from the crowd behind the starting line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bet his gray Tomcat&rsquo;s next litter of kittens
on you,&rdquo; came the voice of a joker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll litter you if I get my hooks on yer, yer
deck-swabbing lubber,&rdquo; bellowed the captain
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready all!&rdquo; warned the starter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>The boys gripped the sides of their sled. Rob,
who was to steer, tautened a turn of the ropes
about his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid a roar from the crowd packed on both
sides of the illuminated hill, the three sleds were
off. Down the narrow lane, edged with human
faces, they flew, Aquebogue, Eagles, and Jack
Curtiss&rsquo; unnamed crew, neck and neck, so to
speak. A great uproar greeted them, but of this
the boys were oblivious. Each steersman bent
his every effort to getting the most out of his
speeding sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Curtiss leads!&rdquo; came a shout, as that
worthy&rsquo;s sled slightly gained on the other two at
a spot where the grade was not quite so steep as
the remainder of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How-oooo!&rdquo; came deep-throatedly from the
Wolves&rsquo; supporters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on you!&rdquo; hissed the Aquebogue steersman,
swaying his body back and forth. But try
as he would, he could not shake off the Eagles.
On they flew; the finish line, with its close-packed
rows of white faces, stared straight in front of
them now.</p>
<p>Jack Curtiss was in the lead by a very slight
margin; then came the Eagles, with the Wolves
right on their rear runners. But, in an unlucky
moment, Bill Bender glanced back and saw how
close Rob and his chums were upon them. With
a sly move, he thrust out his foot, intending to
sway the Eagles&rsquo; sled off its course. Instead,
however, the unexpected drag caused his own
sled to swerve. Amid a cry from the crowd, it
swung round before Jack Curtiss could stop it,
and went plunging up a bank through the crowd,
narrowly avoiding injuring several people.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Eagles&rsquo; borrowed sled,
with Aquebogue a close second, flashed across
the roaring, yelling, horn-blowing finish line,
amid a perfect bombardment of &ldquo;Boom! Boom!
Boom!&rdquo; from the flashlight artists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They threw us over. They did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s their fault!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender, followed by their
two cronies, came rushing up as a congratulatory
crowd pressed about the cup winners.</p>
<p>Jack shook his fist angrily in Rob&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stole the race!&rdquo; he bellowed furiously.
&ldquo;We had it won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won by a mile!&rdquo; declared Freeman Hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By a file, you mean,&rdquo; shot out Rob, looking
straight into the other&rsquo;s eyes. Jack Curtiss&rsquo; gaze
wavered and fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows. Let&rsquo;s leave the babies to
have their candy,&rdquo; he sneered, as, amid the hoots
and laughter of the crowd, he and his cronies
slouched off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A SCHOONER IN TROUBLE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Any of you fellows going down to the water
front?&rdquo; asked Paul Perkins, one bitter Saturday
morning. The air was bound in iron fetters.
Hard, black ice froze up the creek behind his
house&mdash;the same creek which had supplied the
water to quench the wagon house fire&mdash;and a
chill wind was sweeping in from the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water front?&rdquo; echoed Tubby, who, with
Rob and Merritt Crawford, had dropped into
Paul&rsquo;s on their way to the Red Mill pond, where
they meant to enjoy some skating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must need a bath awfully badly if you&rsquo;re
going to plunge in to-day,&rdquo; added the stout
youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to overhaul the iceaeromobile,&rdquo;
declared Paul, who had a big monkey
wrench in his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it down in Redding&rsquo;s
boathouse now. It was the only place I
could find to store it. Sam Redding let me put
it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was white of Sam,&rdquo; declared Rob.
&ldquo;What a change there is in that fellow since he
emerged from the influence of Bill Bender and
his crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; agreed Merritt. &ldquo;Say, fellows,
let&rsquo;s go down and see how the machine
looks. Maybe Paul will give her a try-out, eh,
Paul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; rejoined the inventive youth.
&ldquo;If the ice is over the Inlet good and firm, we
might try it. I&rsquo;d like to, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it was thick enough to bear a wagon,&rdquo;
chimed in Merritt. &ldquo;Wow! feel that wind blow.
If there&rsquo;s any ship off shore, she&rsquo;ll have a hard
time beating up into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Rob; &ldquo;but come on;
let&rsquo;s be getting down to Redding&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;d like to
have another good look at Paul&rsquo;s gasolene bobsled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>The boys were soon at the boatyard. Under
a canvas cover, as they entered, they could see
the outlines of Sam&rsquo;s hydroplane&mdash;the one which
had caused them so much trouble when the Eagle
Patrol was first organized. Other yachts stood
about, shrouded mysteriously in their winter coverings.
Their bare spars looked odd and melancholy,
sticking up like leafless trees in the bitter
wind.</p>
<p>As they had noticed, it was unusually cold, and
the wind from off the sea came sweeping in with
force enough to drive their breaths back when
they faced it. The Inlet was covered for half its
breadth with a sheet of dull, iron gray ice, hummocky
as a plowed field in places. Beyond, they
could see the cold, steel-blue sea, breaking in
showers of spray on the narrow strip of sand and
brush which separated the Inlet from the open
ocean and formed a breakwater. It was a depressing
scene, and the chilliness and cheerlessness
of it was added to by the shrieking voice of
the wind whipping round the sharp angles of the
boatyard buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Merritt suddenly, pointing seaward.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a schooner off there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>He pointed to the southeast, where a small
sailing vessel of some kind could be seen beating
up into the wind, evidently making desperate efforts
to keep off the coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty close in,&rdquo; commented Rob.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have their hands full to claw her off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she?&rdquo; inquired Paul. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make
out her rig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a two-masted schooner from here,&rdquo;
said Rob. &ldquo;My! but she&rsquo;s eating up into that
wind like a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll need to,&rdquo; commented Merritt, as they
entered the boathouse in which the motor-scooter
stood installed, like a mechanical horse. For two
hours or more they worked with Paul over the
strange craft, rigging an inclined support for
the gasolene tank. At last it was completed, to
the young inventor&rsquo;s satisfaction. He declared
that the fuel would feed more rapidly, now that
the improvement had been made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>The job completed, they emerged from the
boathouse, having persuaded Paul to join the
skating party. But what they saw as they came
into full view of the sea drove all thoughts of
skating out of their minds. The schooner they
had noticed earlier in the day was now about off
the Hampton Inlet beach. But she was so close
in that they could almost see the figures moving
about on her decks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-hos-o-phat!&rdquo; shouted Tubby. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be
in the surf in another fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed with him. Desperately as
the crew of the small, two-masted schooner were
working to keep her out of the turmoil of the
wind-driven breakers, she was being slowly but
surely driven into the vortex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t live in them an hour,&rdquo; exclaimed
Rob. &ldquo;Remember what happened to the Sea
Horse when she went ashore off there two years
ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few of her ribs are there yet, and that&rsquo;s
about all,&rdquo; agreed Merritt, &ldquo;and she was a large
vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if the life savers at Lone Hill know
about her,&rdquo; exclaimed Paul. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d better
telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; agreed Rob. &ldquo;Is there one
around here anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one in the yacht club. I&rsquo;ve got a key&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
use that,&rdquo; said Tubby, heading a hasty
dash for the clubhouse. They were soon in the
gloomy, closed-up place, and Rob made for the
telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Central! Give me Quogue 212,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a schooner driving ashore. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
What? Good gracious, you don&rsquo;t say so! That&rsquo;s
hard luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; he exclaimed, turning with a
downcast face from the instrument, &ldquo;she says
that the wires are out of order, and there&rsquo;s no
chance of getting the life savers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one of the beach patrols is bound to
sight her before long,&rdquo; said Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before long she&rsquo;ll be ashore. Let&rsquo;s see!
Are the club field-glasses on that table? Let&rsquo;s
borrow them and take a look at her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>The glasses were soon being brought to bear
on the storm-stressed schooner. She was making
a brave fight for it, driving eastward rapidly,
and looking, from where they were observing
her, to be almost in the midst of the tossing,
crashing breakers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sa-ay!&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, drawing a long
breath, as he handed the glasses to Merritt,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a woman on that schooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-at!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exclamation came from all the lads
simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; confirmed Merritt the next
minute. &ldquo;I can see her standing at the stern.
Seems to be right by the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their faces grew grave, as in turn they gazed
at the little vessel clawing valiantly for sea room,
but being beaten back on every tack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the way she acts I guess her rudder&rsquo;s
broken,&rdquo; reasoned Rob. &ldquo;It seems as if she
won&rsquo;t head into that wind, and from her rig
she ought to do a whole lot better than she is
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Suddenly Paul, who was holding the glasses,
uttered a sharp cry. His face was pale as the
others turned to him to find out the reason for
his exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, there&rsquo;s a kid&mdash;a little fellow on
board there, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Gee Willikens, can&rsquo;t we do
anything but stand here like a lot of clams? We
are a fine bunch of Boy Scouts,&rdquo; burst out Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might walk across the ice,&rdquo; suggested
Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two miles over that ice? We couldn&rsquo;t do it
in two hours,&rdquo; vetoed Rob. &ldquo;I wish we had an
ice-scooter. There are some at Aquebogue, but
that doesn&rsquo;t do us any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; the others were forced to admit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; put in the practical Merritt, &ldquo;a
scooter wouldn&rsquo;t be any good. We could never
beat up into that wind with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; cried Rob suddenly, in a sharp,
excited voice. &ldquo;Say, Paul, now&rsquo;s the time to try
out your iceaero-what-you-may-call-um.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumping bob cats, Rob Blake, do you think
we can do it with that?&rdquo; gasped Tubby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, if the ice will bear. It&rsquo;s thick
enough to carry a scooter, all right, and that
thing-um-me-bob isn&rsquo;t much heavier. Can you
run her, Paul?&rdquo; he added, with sudden anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can a duck swim?&rdquo; came back the indignant
reply. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to do is to turn on the gasolene
and the switch, tickle the carburetor, and off
we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll try it. I&rsquo;m not going to see a
woman and a kid go to Davy Jones without stirring
a finger to help them,&rdquo; declared Rob.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows. Tubby you get a coil of
rope; there&rsquo;s some in that locker, plenty of it&mdash;come
on, boys, we haven&rsquo;t got any time to be
talking, either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Off they darted, and by the time Tubby joined
them with two or three coils of half-inch manila
rope, the others had the iceaeromobile out by
way of the big front doors that opened seaward,
and led on to a runway sloping downward into
what had been water, but now was ice. At the
top of the runway they made a rope fast to the
stern of the odd craft, and then, taking a turn
round a big iron &ldquo;crab,&rdquo; paid out the rope gradually
till Paul&rsquo;s invention stood on, what he intended
to be, her native element.</p>
<p>The rope was then cast off, and the Boy Scouts
crowded aboard, Tubby and Merritt clinging on
behind the seat, while Paul seated himself in the
driver&rsquo;s place. Rob, after being carefully instructed,
ran to the stern to work the aeroplane
propeller, which was expected to drive the queer
craft forward. While he did this, Paul shoved
forward a lever which dug a spiked brake down
into the ice, holding the craft firm till the engine
was working in good shape.</p>
<p>In the intense cold it was necessary to prime
the engine&mdash;that is, inject gasolene into it from
a cup on top of the cylinders for that purpose,
before it would start. Finally, after a lot of
swinging of the propeller, there came a sharp
explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; shouted Merritt and Tubby, as a
whiff of blue smoke was whipped shoreward by
the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pup-pup! Pur-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r! Pup!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s off!&rdquo; yelled Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; shouted Merritt, as Rob darted
forward, being careful to avoid the rapidly
whirring propeller, which would have beheaded
him at one sweep if it had struck him. He swung
himself into the seat beside Paul, digging in with
his &ldquo;toenails,&rdquo; as he expressed it afterward. The
next instant Paul released the lever which manipulated
the brake.</p>
<p>Like an arrow from a bow, off shot the iceaeromobile,
scooting across the ice at such a pace
that it fairly took their breaths away.</p>

<p class="caption">Like an arrow from a bow, off shot the iceaeromobile, scooting across the ice at such a pace that it fairly took their breaths away.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;She works!&rdquo; yelled Paul, throttling the engine
down a bit as they dashed along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, she does,&rdquo; shouted Rob back in his
ear above the roaring of the engine, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s
getting a great trial trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the eastward, where she was now being
driven, they could see the schooner. Paul gave
his steering wheel a slight twist, swinging over
the front bob. Obediently the iceaeromobile
swung around, too, answering her helm as a perfectly-trained
horse obeys his bridle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Paul, you&rsquo;re a blessed genius!&rdquo; shouted one
of the passengers, clinging on for dear life behind.
But the wind whipped his words shoreward
without their being heard by the lads on
the seat.</p>
<p>Over the ice, for two miles or more up the Inlet,
which branched out and ran eastward at this
point, the motor ice-scooter drove. It was rough
riding, but none of them minded that. The fact&mdash;the
glorious fact that they were riding in such
a craft as no man or boy had ever ridden in before&mdash;was
a tonic in their veins. They could
have sung aloud for joy if the cold had not
cracked their lips and dried their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the De Regny mansion,&rdquo; shouted
Rob, pointing shoreward at the gloomy old place
among its dark trees. &ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;ve covered the
distance in ten minutes. I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed
it possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ice doesn&rsquo;t offer much resistance,&rdquo;
shouted back Paul modestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>At last the head of the Inlet was reached, and
Paul shut off his engine. A lever thrown into
place acted on an ingenious arrangement of cogs
and reversed the propeller. With the aid of his
spiked brake, the young inventor brought his
mile-a-minute craft to a dead stop within two
hundred feet of the place where he first shut off
the power. The iceaeromobile had been tried
and not found wanting.</p>
<p>But other things than the success of Paul&rsquo;s invention
engaged their attention now. Not more
than half a mile from them the schooner was laboring
bravely still, when something happened
that proved the beginning of the end. The boys
saw her foresails torn bodily from their ropes by
the wind, and sent scurrying like birds, inland,
toward the De Regny house. The next instant,
deprived of all means of keeping her head up to
the seas, the schooner broached to. Almost before
they could realize what had occurred, the
doomed vessel was in the midst of the rolling
breakers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>As they gazed, a cry of horror went up from
the boys. It was fairly forced from their throats
by the apparent hopelessness of the schooner&rsquo;s
position. Like a helpless log, she was driven
shoreward, while over her and about her the
green seas lifted and broke as if in triumph at
their victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MOTOR-SCOOTERS TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns, we&rsquo;re too late!&rdquo; groaned Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. See! she&rsquo;s not awash yet,&rdquo; cried Rob.
&ldquo;Look! they are climbing into her rigging. Come
on, fellows, run as you never ran before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hard work plowing along that soft
beach with the bitter wind fighting them every
inch of the way, but the Boy Scouts stuck to it
doggedly. Before long they were opposite the
turmoil of waters in which the unfortunate
schooner lay.</p>
<p>To their astonishment, however, she was not
in such a desperate plight as had at first seemed
the case. Her decks were still unswept by the
waves, although, occasionally, a big sea would
break against her side and fling a smother of
spray almost as big as her topmasts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s stuck on that sandy shoal the captain
told us about,&rdquo; said Rob comprehendingly. &ldquo;It
runs along the beach here at just about the distance
she lies off shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish those life savers were here with their
gun,&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got lots of rope
here, but how are we going to reach them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This problem, however, was solved more easily
than they imagined. A bearded man clambered
into the lee rigging as he spied the party on the
shore, and, after a dozen attempts, succeeded in
flinging a light line with a leaden weight attached
to it to the beach. The wind helped him,
or otherwise he could not have succeeded, but
as it happened, Providence was good to the
stranded schooner in this respect, at least.</p>
<p>Seizing up the light line, the boys ran back on
the beach with it, and guided by the man&rsquo;s gesticulations,
they began to haul on it for all they
were worth. Presently it was seen that a heavier
line was attached to the first one, and was evidently
intended to serve as a life rope between
the vessel and the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>The lads cast about them for some place to
which to make the line fast. Soon they spied
the gaunt framework of an old range light, long
disused. The timbers seemed stout, however,
and in a jiffy they had the line fastened with two
double half hitches on the uprights. In the meantime,
the men on the schooner had made their
end fast.</p>
<p>Before taking this latter action, they had slid
the rope through the handles of a stout basket,
intending, it seemed, to use it in getting ashore.
As the rope was inclined at quite a steep angle,
this looked as if it would be an easy matter. As
the boys waited for the first person to take the
perilous trip over and through the waves, some
members of the crew began handing the woman
and child up the shrouds. But before they could
get anywhere near the basket, a man&rsquo;s form was
seen to dash past them, pushing them so roughly
aside that they were almost projected into the
sea. The next instant the intruder was in the
basket and several feet out from the ship&rsquo;s side.
On he came toward the beach, clawing at the line
and pulling himself along, hand over hand. The
bearded man had leaped into the rigging and was
shaking his fist furiously after him, but he was
far too engrossed with securing a safe passage
for himself to pay any attention to this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine coward, whoever he is,&rdquo; commented
Rob, as the man in the basket neared the
shore. But at this point the weight on the rope
caused it to sag till the basket was immersed
completely in the immense waves. Gasping and
fighting for breath, they could see the crawling
figure on the rope emerge again and again from
the vortex of one of the big waves. At last, with
a howl of anguish, he vanished altogether. As
the wave that had engulfed him rolled on shoreward,
it could be seen that there was nothing on
the line. The force of the big sea had torn the
basket off, and hurled its living freight into the
turmoil of water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>The Boy Scouts dashed down the beach to
watch for the man&rsquo;s reappearance. As the big
wave broke, they saw him. Rolled helplessly up
the beach in the tumble of waters, he would have
been drawn back when the wave receded, but for
the fact that Rob had already acted. Rapidly instructing
the others to form a chain, of which
Tubby acted as the anchor, the leader of the
Eagle Patrol waded waist deep into the water.
Just as the wave was about to drag back its prey,
the boy&rsquo;s strong arms closed around the man,
who was by this time unconscious, and dragged
him up upon the beach.</p>
<p>As the boys gazed down into the features of
the man they had rescued, they broke into involuntary
exclamations of amazement. The man
was no stranger to any of them.</p>
<p>It was Hank Handcraft, the former beach-comber.
A thick beard now covered the lower
part of his face, but about his identity there could
be no question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drag him further up the beach,&rdquo; ordered Rob,
their first surprise over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea how he
comes to be out of prison, but we&rsquo;ve no time to
worry over that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout from Merritt, who had been gazing
down the beach, caused them all to turn their
heads from the unconscious man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray! Here comes the life savers!&rdquo; he
cried, and sure enough, from the direction in
which he pointed, came the brave beach patrolmen
from the Lone Hill Life Saving Station.
Two stout horses dragged their &ldquo;rope-gun&rdquo; and
a large dory boat. Hasty explanations were soon
exchanged between Captain Ed Baker of the life
savers and the boys, all of whom knew him well.
While these were being made, the men of the
Life Saving Station rigged a line, and presently
a sharp report was heard as their rope flew seaward
and fell over the deck of the schooner. It
was soon made fast, and then a breeches buoy
was sent across. The first person to come ashore
in it was the woman they had seen on their wild
trip across the ice. She clasped in her arms a
little lad about four years old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Rob and the boys were set to work by Captain
Baker with the medicine chest, administering
restoratives to the woman. She explained to
them that she was the wife of Captain Tom
Pratt, the skipper and owner of the schooner,
the Vesper of New York. They had set sail the
day before, bound for the West Indies, and without
a cargo. The gale which they encountered
at midnight had proven too much for them, and
for ten terrible hours they waited for death.</p>
<p>Tubby, who had been looking after Hank
Handcraft, announced presently that the man
showed signs of life, and was coming to. This
induced Rob to ask Mrs. Pratt if she knew anything
about the fellow. She replied that she did
not. He had shipped at the vessel&rsquo;s Brooklyn
Wharf only the day before, and her husband being
short a man had signed him on.</p>
<p>Before long all the crew were ashore. The
last man to make the voyage in the breeches
buoy was Captain Tom Pratt. He thanked the
boys warmly, and he and his wife could not say
too much in praise of their bravery and that of
the life saving crew.</p>
<p>Hank Handcraft had, by this time, recovered,
and had recognized the boys with a wild cry of
surprise in which alarm mingled. He begged
them piteously not to be hard on him. He had
escaped from the western penitentiary in which
he had been confined and had made his way east,
he said, and then shipped on the Vesper in hopes
of beginning a new life in the West Indies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t cause you any trouble as long as
you behave yourself,&rdquo; Rob promised him. &ldquo;But
I can&rsquo;t answer for the captain of the Vesper,&rdquo;
he said, as Tom Pratt approached with thunder
in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You miserable varmint! You yaller dog!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a notion to throw you back
inter the sea, if it wasn&rsquo;t that even the waves
would throw you back again. This feller, boys,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, turning to the life savers, &ldquo;threw
my wife aside and tried to save himself on the
life line them brave boys helped us rig up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low, angry growl came from the life savers,
and Pratt&rsquo;s crew advanced threateningly upon
Hank. The wretched creature threw himself on
his knees and whimpered like a baby as he saw
these danger signals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! Leave him alone,&rdquo; said Captain Pratt
disgustedly, turning to his wife. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t soil
my hands on the critter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>The boys&rsquo; motor-scooter&mdash;which caused great
wonderment to the life savers and the rescued
crew, as may be imagined&mdash;did good work in
taking the shipwrecked men ashore. A big crowd
met them on their first trip, and the cheers that
went up for the Boy Scouts were deafening.
They reached the ears of Jack Curtiss and his
crowd, and of Stonington Hunt. The former
broker was as vindictively malicious as the others
when he heard that his enemies, as he designated
them, had again distinguished themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be even with them yet,&rdquo; he grated out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneaking into the limelight again,&rdquo; sniffed
Jack, as he and his chums joined the crowd on
the water front.</p>
<p>Hank Handcraft was the last to be brought
over, but none in the crowd recognized him with
his heavy beard and pale, woe-begone face. With
a growled-out, grudging word of thanks, he
parted from the Boy Scouts and made his way
up the village street. But he was not to go altogether
unrecognized. Jack Curtiss and Bill
Bender, after an incredulous glance, were convinced
they had made no mistake in their man,
and followed him up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hank!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, coming up behind
the fellow and laying his hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumping periwinkles! It&rsquo;s Jack Curtiss!&rdquo; exclaimed
Hank. &ldquo;The very fellow I want to see,
too. Have you got a quiet place we can go and
where you can give me a good drink?&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll
tell you something that&rsquo;s worth your while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth while. What are you getting at?&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack incredulously, for he knew Hank of
old. &ldquo;I heard about your escape. Why, you are
just an escaped convict. What can you know
that&rsquo;s worth while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know there is two thousand dollars in good
money right on that schooner,&rdquo; was the astonishing
response, &ldquo;and if you keep me hid and the
boat don&rsquo;t break up I&rsquo;ll pay you well for your
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;re not at your old tricks, Hank?&rdquo;
questioned Jack and Bill, in one breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s true as gospel. You believe me,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>The outcast, wet, dripping, and miserable as
he was, had a convincing ring in his voice as he
hinted at his improbable tale.</p>
<p>But Jack was so dishonest and unreliable himself
that he applied the same standards to everybody
else&mdash;and with some justice in Hank&rsquo;s case.
He, therefore, made a non-committal reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a place where I can hide you, Hank,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;till we find out if your yarn is true or
not. In the meantime, come on and get on some
dry clothes, and throw a feed into yourself.
Then you can tell us your story. If you&rsquo;re lying
to us, it will go hard with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were as sure of going to heaven as
I am that there is two thousand dollars on that
schooner,&rdquo; grunted Hank, in reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JIM DUGAN AGAIN.</span></h2>
<p>As you can readily imagine, it was some time
before the fame of the lads&rsquo; exploit in going to
the rescue of the crew of the stranded Vesper
died out. All the praise that came their way,
however, the lads accepted without undue self-satisfaction.
In fact, everybody else seemed to
consider what they had done as being much more
remarkable than they themselves did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Captain Baker&rsquo;s Lone
Hill fellows, we wouldn&rsquo;t have got anybody off,&rdquo;
was the way Rob put it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>One person there was in town who heard the
news with an added interest, apart from the
thrilling details of the actual work of getting the
men through the surf. This man was Stonington
Hunt. After hearing of the performance
of the motor-scooter, he was more convinced than
ever that the machine was a practicable invention,
in which it would pay him handsomely to
secure a controlling interest. As he himself
often said, he was not a man to be easily beaten,
and presently, after much casting about and
quiet investigation, he lighted on a plan which
he considered would place Paul&rsquo;s interests in his
hands and compel the boy to sell him the rights
to the manufacture of other Motor-Scooters.
What this plan was we shall see ere long.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nothing more had been heard
of the former beach-comber who had so mysteriously
reappeared and then vanished again. Although
they made inquiries, none of the boys
could find out what had become of him, and all
their investigations along this line came to nothing.
The Vesper still lay on the sand bar on
which she had grounded. She had been fully insured,
so Captain Pratt did not suffer great loss,
and the insurance company, after a survey of the
spot in which she lay, decided that it would be
impracticable to remove her. She was a stout
Nova Scotian built vessel, of good oak and pine,
and, despite the buffeting she had been through,
held together almost as intact as when she first
grounded. The boys often planned to take an
excursion to her some fine day in the spring,
when the sea was more moderate than it was in
the winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>Toward the middle of April, the Boy Scouts
decided that their organization was flourishing to
such a degree that they needed more spacious
quarters than those above the bank of which
Rob&rsquo;s father was president, and a large barn-like
building on the main street&mdash;formerly a
seine-net factory&mdash;being vacant, was fitted up as
an armory, not all at once, of course, but by
degrees. A minstrel show and other entertainments
helped pay the expenses of fitting up the
new quarters, and when they were completed no
patrol in the state could boast more commodious
or comfortable headquarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>With the coming of spring, Lieutenant Duvall
returned and took up his residence in the old De
Regny mansion, and several other officers of the
signal corps came with him. The arrival of half
a dozen or more mysterious boxes and crates at
the house gave rise to rumors that the government
was going to carry out some extensive aeronautical
experiments as soon as the weather grew
favorable, and, naturally, among the most curious
persons concerning these doings were our
lads.</p>
<p>They got little satisfaction from the young
officer, however. Although they were always
welcome guests at the De Regny place, they understood
that the experiments about to be carried
out were in the nature of secret tests, and,
after their first questions had been politely but
firmly unanswered, they asked no more. This
did not detract a bit, though, from the enjoyment
they found in visiting the place on Saturday
afternoons, and watching the private soldiers
of the Signal Corps equipping the aeroplanes
for the spring and summer work. &ldquo;Spring
styles in aeroplanes,&rdquo; Tubby called it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>From time to time, however, the officer in
charge of the station let drop a hint here and
there which convinced the boys that the experiments
were to be in the main devoted to testing
the deadliness of dropped explosives and bombs.</p>
<p>One of the officer&rsquo;s expansive moments came
one afternoon when they were on the brick terrace
watching the trying out of a new engine on
a large biplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see how near I could come to putting
that old hulk out of the way,&rdquo; he remarked,
waving his hand seaward to where the black hull
of the wrecked Vesper lay, her two masts
stretched up like appealing hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop a bomb on her, you mean?&rdquo; asked
Tubby, with round eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;d make a fine mark. A good thing
to have her out of the way, too. I think I&rsquo;ll try
to see if the department can&rsquo;t have it arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a great sight!&rdquo; agreed Rob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to see it. I suppose one of your projectiles
would blow her to bits, if you hit her fair and
square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much left to bother
over,&rdquo; admitted the lieutenant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>While this conversation was going on between
the boys and the friendly young officer, a vastly
different scene was transpiring in a room at the
Southport Hospital, which was situated some
miles from Hampton. In a private room there,
Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender were seated by the
bedside of a gaunt, pallid man, who had evidently
just recovered from a severe illness. The
man was Hank Handcraft, but so emaciated was
he that any one would have had some difficulty in
recognizing him. He had collapsed from the
strain of his life since escaping from the prison
in the west, and had become so ill that Jack and
his cronies had found it necessary to have him
removed from the small cottage belonging to
Jack&rsquo;s father, in which they had hoped to hide
him till the time was ripe for investigating the
wreck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>A problem had then faced the lads which was
not solved till Stonington Hunt was taken into
the secret. He possessed some influence at the
hospital and on his word that Hank Handcraft
was a reputable man named James Smiley, the
former beach-comber had been admitted there.
Stonington Hunt was not influenced by philanthropy
in this matter. His main desire was to
see Hank get well speedily so that he could guide
them to the location of the money on the wrecked
Vesper.</p>
<p>On this spring afternoon Jack and Bill had visited
the hospital and were readily admitted to
the sickroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must warn you, gentlemen, that James
Smiley is a very sick man, and you must not
bother him or excite him,&rdquo; the house surgeon had
said, as they left the office in charge of a nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he been delirious lately, Miss Jones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not since daybreak,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;but last night, so the night nurse told me, he
raved and talked for hour after hour about some
money hidden on a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, what delusions a sick man
will get?&rdquo; mused the surgeon.</p>
<p>The boys were shocked, in spite of their hard,
callous natures, at the change for the worse in
Hank&rsquo;s appearance since they had seen him a
week before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Hank, you must brace up,&rdquo; said Jack,
as the nurse left the room and they were alone.
&ldquo;It will soon be time to take a trip to the Vesper
for that coin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never go,&rdquo; rejoined Hank gloomily;
&ldquo;but I have drawn a rough map here to show
you where I hid the money in a crack behind
some beams in the forecastle. You must get it,
and I must trust to you to divide it fairly with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that, Hank,&rdquo; Bill assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the map?&rdquo; asked Jack, a greedy light
coming into his hard eyes.</p>
<p>Hank stretched an emaciated arm forth and
drew from under his mattress a crumpled bit of
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the third beam from the foot of the companionway
steps,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t miss it
with this map to guide you. See, it is all set
down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated some lines and marks on the paper,
which Jack promptly took and pocketed.
After some more conversation, they left the sick
man and set out for their trip back to Hampton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Hank, I think he was right. He has
not long to live, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Bill Bender, as
they were strolling down the road leading to the
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he should die before we get the money,&rdquo;
said Jack, in a low voice, &ldquo;then we would not
have to divide it. It would be all ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if he isn&rsquo;t giving us a fairy tale,&rdquo; said
Bill Bender. &ldquo;That story of his about how he
and another fellow&mdash;a tramp he met&mdash;broke into
a post office and robbed it of that money sounds
rather fishy to me. What would all that money
be doing in a country post office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He explained that,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;it was in
Montana and the money was deposited in the post
office safe to pay off the miners at a copper mine
not far off. It was the only safe place they could
put it in that lawless country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got wind of it from overhearing the
postmaster telling a friend about it, didn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was the way Hank tells it. His tramp
friend made a mixture of some stuff Hank called
&lsquo;soup&rsquo; and squirted it into the cracks of the safe
door with an oil can. Then they blew off the
door and escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Hank is mad with himself for getting
too scared to take it with him when he left
the wreck,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he is,&rdquo; agreed Jack carelessly; &ldquo;but
that is not our funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening there was a consultation at
Stonington Hunt&rsquo;s home. Jack and Bill related
what they had heard from Hank and exhibited
the map. Stonington Hunt seemed overjoyed.
Rising from the table, he went to the door and
looked out into the night. It was still and calm,
one of those breathless, starry nights that come
in early spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when will we take a trip out there?&rdquo;
he asked, coming back to his seat. &ldquo;It looks to-night
as if we&rsquo;d have a perfect day to-morrow.
What do you say if we make a try for it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;How about you fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Freeman, falling in with the
rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t any one be suspicious if they see
us leaving the harbor in a boat?&rdquo; asked Bill Bender
cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they be?&rdquo; demanded Stonington
Hunt, his crafty eyes glittering with greedy anticipation.
&ldquo;There are several launches in the
water already. We&rsquo;ll hire one and say we are
going outside on a fishing trip. We&rsquo;ll take
squids and bait and lines as a blind. No one will
suspect, and the wreck lies away up the beach off
that old house in the hemlocks where those army
idiots are experimenting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard they are going to take up bomb-dropping
practice,&rdquo; said Jack, in a careless voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they don&rsquo;t drop one on us,&rdquo; laughed
Bill Bender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob,&rdquo; said his father that evening after supper,
&ldquo;I had a letter this afternoon from Job
Trevor, that garage man at Willitson. He incloses
a bill for one hundred and fifty dollars. I
thought I had paid it, but evidently I had not.
Wonder if you&rsquo;d go over there, provided you
have nothing better to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll go, dad,&rdquo; said Rob willingly.
&ldquo;We had a drill on for to-night, but Merritt can
take it for me. Anyway, I guess I can get over
there and back in time to be present at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my boy,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care to let bills run up, and, as you say, you
ought to get there and back in time for your
drill if you hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll hurry,&rdquo; Rob assured him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>The leader of the Eagles &rsquo;phoned to Merritt
that he might be delayed a little on his errand
and asked the corporal to take charge in his absence.
Merritt readily agreed to do this, and
Rob, whistling a merry tune, hastened off to the
shed at the rear of the house in which Mr.
Blake&rsquo;s auto was kept, to prepare for his trip.
Soon afterward he chugged out of the yard and
was off. It was about ten miles to Willitson,
and Rob was not particularly observant of the
speed laws as he cut across the island. It was
exhilarating sport, speeding along on the deserted
roads. Once he met another auto. It
was going almost as fast as he was, and the two
vehicles whizzed by each other at tremendous
speed. They did not go so fast, however, that
the occupants of the other car did not turn and
look back into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Dugan,&rdquo; said one of them, a small,
yellow-faced man&mdash;a Jap, in fact, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t that
face familiar to you in the flash we had of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only got a glance at it,&rdquo; rejoined the driver
of the car, a heavy-set, big-jowled man, with an
immense pair of shoulders; &ldquo;but it did seem to
me I&rsquo;d seen it some place before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was one of the boys that attacked us
on the road that day, Dugan,&rdquo; rejoined Hashashi,
with a vindictive snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; snorted Dugan angrily. &ldquo;I wish
I&rsquo;d known that, I&rsquo;d have run him down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that to-night we want to make
ourselves as inconspicuous as possible,&rdquo; was the
rejoinder. &ldquo;You had better keep a sharp lookout&mdash;we
are nearing the town now, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;ll run the car off on this
side lane and wait till it&rsquo;s late enough for us to
start working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; chuckled the Jap. &ldquo;We remind me
of those funny pills. Work while they sleep, eh,
my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope they sleep,&rdquo; grunted Dugan,
turning off the main road into a rough cart-track.
&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t, they are likely to get some
pills they don&rsquo;t like&mdash;lead ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are too much of an expert not to
be able to extract a paper from a country bank
without rousing the whole town,&rdquo; said the Jap
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me, Hashi, old boy. I&rsquo;ll
do the trick with neatness and dispatch, and when
I&rsquo;m at the head of the Japanese Aero Squad
we&rsquo;ll have many a good laugh over this night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>As he spoke, the car came to a stop, and the
two occupants got out and stretched their legs.
It appeared that they had ridden a long way
and were stiff and cramped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better put out the lights,&rdquo; said Dugan. As
he spoke, he bent over the headlights, and before
he extinguished them drew out his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long
time we&rsquo;ve got to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the contemplation of great achievements,
the hours pass pleasantly,&rdquo; rejoined the Jap
philosophically, clambering back into the car and
making himself a snug nest with the blankets
and robes. Presently he slept, but Dugan, leaning
against the car, gazed with speculative eyes
from the hilltop down toward the spot where a
faint glow marked the site of the village of
Hampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a risky game, Jim Dugan,&rdquo; he growled to
himself, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re playing for the biggest stake
that you ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A CHASE IN THE NIGHT.</span></h2>
<p>But Rob was disappointed in his hopes of getting
back early to Hampton. In fact, he encountered
a regular chapter of accidents to delay him.
In the first place, the man he had come to see
was not in, and he had to wait for an hour till
he put in an appearance.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he had telephoned to Hampton
that he might not be back till late, so that
he knew the drill would go on without him, and
this helped to make the wait less aggravating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>He set out for home at a good speed, but
hardly had he gone two hundred yards beyond
the garage he had visited, than &ldquo;pop!&rdquo; went a
rear tire. By the light of a detached headlight,
Rob examined it and found, to his dismay, that
he had run over a broken bottle in the darkness
and cut through both inner and outer tubes.
That meant a long delay, for he knew what country
garages were. However, there was no help
for it, and, amid jeering cries of &ldquo;Get a horse&rdquo;
from East Willitson small boys, he summoned
help and wheeled the car back to the repair place.</p>
<p>This was not the sum of his troubles, however.
The repair man&rsquo;s helper was an awkward
youth, who apparently knew more about plows
and harrows than he did about automobiles. At
any rate, he succeeded in smashing part of the
steering gear as they were jacking the car up,
which required still further time to set it to
rights.</p>
<p>As he left the garage, Rob saw, to his amazement
(for long as the delay had been, he had not
dreamed it was so late) that it was almost midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to hustle if I&rsquo;m going to get any sleep,&rdquo;
thought the lad to himself as he bade the garage
man &ldquo;good-night,&rdquo; the latter having magnanimously
refused to take any pay for the repairing
of the break caused by his helper&rsquo;s carelessness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Once out of the place, however, he made good
time, till within a mile of home, when something
went wrong with the radiator, which necessitated
a further delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing we&rsquo;re an orderly, law-abiding
community down here,&rdquo; thought Rob, smiling to
himself, &ldquo;or I would offer a good opportunity to
an enterprising hold-up man. By George! Old
Jenkins, the constable, is laid up with a smashed
ankle, too. Well, Jenkins wasn&rsquo;t capable of much
anyhow, except to carry that big star around
against a suitable background. Now, then, Mr.
Radiator, if you&rsquo;re ready we&rsquo;ll go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying&mdash;or rather thinking&mdash;the lad got
back into the car and set off once more, the cheerful
song of the motor delighting him after its
temporary fit of backsliding.</p>
<p>In a few minutes he was at the head of the
village street, dark, and deserted, of course, at
that hour. Presently the white outline of the
bank, the only stone building in the village, came
into view, and as it did so Rob gave an amazed
exclamation:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a light in there. Wonder who
can be working late. I thought Jennings and
the rest had&mdash;&mdash;. Hullo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light had gone out as suddenly as if a
hand had been placed over it. Plucky as he was,
Rob could not repress an involuntary shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong,&rdquo; he said to himself.
He muffled down the motor and stopped
half a block or more from the bank building.
Then, with a heart that beat so hard that it shook
his frame, he began cautiously tiptoeing down
the darkened street. He kept on till he reached
the bank, and then catching hold of the window
coping, he raised himself silently till he could
peer through the big plate glass window into
the interior. At first it seemed as black as a pit
in there and Rob began to think that his eyes
might have played him a trick.</p>
<p>But the next instant he knew they hadn&rsquo;t. At
the rear of the main floor of the bank a sudden
tiny glow of light flashed. No bigger than the
midget lantern of a fire-fly it seemed, but as Rob&rsquo;s
eyes encountered it he knew that some human
agency was at work within.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>And now the light began to come closer and
Rob guessed that it was a pocket electric torch.
Whoever was carrying it came to the door&mdash;which
was opened, it seemed, and peered out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All clear,&rdquo; this figure muttered to itself,
while Rob, who had dropped from the window at
its approach, cowered back against the wall as
flat as he could make himself.</p>
<p>And now Rob could hear, from the back of
the bank, a queer, rasping noise. It sounded not
unlike the harsh drone of big bumble bees. What
could it be? His ignorance was soon to be enlightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep that drill quiet, Dugan,&rdquo; came from the
man at the door; &ldquo;you will wake the whole town
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the noise stopped, and as it did so the
man at the door was joined by another. Hardly
had the second dark figure glided into view before
there was a muffled roar from within the
bank and the ground vibrated under Rob&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Like a flash, the words of Lieutenant Duvall
flashed into his mind:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dugan, I have found out, was once an expert
safe-blower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second figure had been addressed as Dugan.
From what Rob could make out of the
hazy outline of his big frame, it was the deserter.
Evidently what had just happened was
the blowing open of the big safe which served
the Hampton bank in place of a strong room.
With a swift flash of intuition the lad realized
what was taking place. The two rascals, of
whom the first was undoubtedly the Jap, were
after the plans of Lieutenant Duvall&rsquo;s equalizer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix them,&rdquo; thought Rob, feeling in his
pocket for his Boy Scout alarm whistle. Three
blasts on it would bring the Eagles and the Hawks
about him in a jiffy, all those within hearing,
that is.</p>
<p>But before he blew the alarm Rob was prudent
enough to softly tiptoe to a safe distance. So
silently did he proceed that he did not believe it
was possible for the men in the bank to have
heard him. But the next instant he was undeceived.
Rob had been seen, and the Jap had
crept after him as silently as he himself had progressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drop that whistle or I shall be compelled to
shoot you,&rdquo; said a soft voice in the startled boy&rsquo;s
ear. As the purring accents reached him, Rob
could feel the chilly impress of a revolver muzzle
against the back of his neck. With a quick,
snake-like turn, Rob ducked and fairly slid up
under the astonished Jap&rsquo;s arm before the other
could realize what had happened. With a quick
wrench the Oriental was dispossessed of the pistol,
and Rob, master of the situation, placed the
whistle to his lips, while with the other hand he
leveled the revolver at the quaking Jap.</p>
<p>Three shrill calls rang out clear and loud on
the early morning air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you stand there till they come and put
you in the lock-up,&rdquo; warned Rob, standing motionless
as a statue before the yellow man, and
keeping the pistol pointed straight at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly you have me in a trap, honorable
youth,&rdquo; said the Jap. &ldquo;I weep for my native
Nippon, which I fear I may never see again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>He seemed to be overcome with an excess of
grief, and moved one hand downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; snapped out Rob, devoutly hoping
his companions would be quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My handkerchief, honorable sir,&rdquo; sobbed the
Jap; &ldquo;may I not dry my tears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it for you,&rdquo; said Rob, sternly, and
leaning forward, still keeping the pistol leveled,
he drew a square of linen from the other&rsquo;s
breast pocket. As he did so, he became conscious
of a strange odor in the air. The next instant
a dark figure came leaping out of the bank,
clutching something in its grip, and approaching
them with leaps and bounds. It was Dugan. But
as Rob gazed at the approaching fellow a sudden
feeling of terrible lassitude overcame him.
Dugan, the Jap, the bank, everything, grew
hazy. He felt himself falling backward and tried
desperately to catch himself. But his effort was a
failure. Dropping the pistol from his nerveless
fingers, Rob Blake collapsed in a heap on the
sidewalk as Dugan came rushing up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! An excellent idea to keep Orhsimi, the
Japanese sleeping powder, in my handkerchief;
see, honorable Dugan, our young enemy is disposed
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stooping by Rob&rsquo;s recumbent form, the Jap
picked up the pistol and placed it in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; exclaimed Dugan, suddenly.</p>
<p>A strange sound was in the air. It was the
patter-patter of dozens of young feet. The Boy
Scouts, roused by the startling summons of their
leader, were coming to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out of this, and get out of it
quick,&rdquo; exclaimed Dugan, excitedly; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have
a whole hornet&rsquo;s nest about our ears if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the box with the plans in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the smoke was so confounded thick
that I could hardly see to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>The last two speeches we have recorded were
exchanged while the two rascals were diving
down a side street where their automobile was
concealed. As the Boy Scouts came pouring
round the corner, to be met by a cloud of acrid
smoke rolling from the open bank door, there
was a sharp &ldquo;chug-chug!&rdquo; as the former soldier
and the treacherous Jap made off with their spoil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What is it? Who blew
the alarm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and a thousand other questions came
from the anxious boys as they ran about trying
to discover what had happened, and what was
the matter. A cry from Merritt summoned them
down the street past the bank. The corporal had
stumbled over Rob&rsquo;s unconscious form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob! Rob! What is it?&rdquo; he was saying as
the others came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody must have struck him and left him
here,&rdquo; said Tubby. &ldquo;Fan his face, Merritt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal produced a handkerchief and vigorously
fanned the recumbent lad&rsquo;s countenance.
It so happened that in doing this he removed the
subtle powder which the crafty Jap had had concealed
in his handkerchief, and as its fumes lost
their effect Rob awoke. At first he gazed dazedly
about him, but presently all that had happened
came rushing back to his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did they get away?&rdquo; he asked in a feeble
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, old fellow?&rdquo; asked Tubby, &ldquo;whom do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those chaps who robbed the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll explain it all afterward. Did they
get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An auto just chugged off down H street, if
that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; volunteered Hiram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down H street,&rdquo; echoed Rob, &ldquo;that leads into
the New York road, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; rejoined Merritt, &ldquo;but what has
that to do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, cutting him
short; &ldquo;come on, boys. My dad&rsquo;s car is just up
the street. We&rsquo;ve got to take after those fellows
and have them arrested. They&rsquo;ve got valuable
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob! They&rsquo;ve stolen the airship plans?&rdquo;
gasped Tubby, guessing what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But come on,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob,
frantically tugging at his chum&rsquo;s coat-sleeves.
Leaving the others behind with orders to telephone
to the various villages about, to apprehend
the robbers if they appeared there, the boy, followed
by his chums, made for his automobile
which, it will be recalled, he had left a short distance
up the street. A few turns of the crank
and a quick snap as spark and gasolene were
turned on, and then a quick dash round the corner
into H street and a flying leap down the country
road leading into the turnpike to New York!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll catch them, Rob?&rdquo; asked.
Tubby, bending forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the rejoinder; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t
even know that they have gone this way. We
can only guess at it and hope we are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on flew the auto through the night,
past sleeping villages, through lonely patches of
road where dark woods grew right up to the sides
of the road, up hills and down steep grades, but
still no sight of the auto they were pursuing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>Suddenly, as they topped a small rise, Tubby
gave a shout. Below them, and not more than a
quarter of a mile off, they could see the gleam
of a tail lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an auto!&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt, &ldquo;but is it
the right one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys, except Rob, who was at the wheel,
arose to their feet in their excitement as they
drew nearer the car ahead, which appeared to be
stationary.</p>
<p>All at once, however, the sharp staccato rattle
of its exhaust sounded, and the dim lights were
whisked off at what seemed considerable speed.
Evidently the car had been halted for something&mdash;perhaps
to examine the stolen box&mdash;and
the sight of the approaching lights had warned
its occupants that these might be signs of a pursuer.</p>
<p>Such was the guess the boys made anyhow,
and it was not long before all doubts as to who
was in the front car were dissipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that car or I&rsquo;ll fire at you,&rdquo; roared back
a voice which the boys recognized as Dugan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The only answer they vouchsafed was to keep
on going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A bullet screamed past from the car in front
and whistled by the boys&rsquo; ears. They could see
the red flash of the discharged pistol against the
blackness ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to show you we mean business. The
next will come closer,&rdquo; came the same voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only bluffing. He can&rsquo;t see anything in
this light,&rdquo; whispered Tubby.</p>
<p>Suddenly from somewhere to the eastward
there came a hoarse, harsh whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A train!&rdquo; cried Rob, as he heard; &ldquo;must be
a night freight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon that&rsquo;s what it is. This must be the
central division of the Long Island Railroad,&rdquo;
said Tubby. &ldquo;Wow, we&rsquo;ve come way out of our
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be off, too,&rdquo; said Rob; &ldquo;we simply
followed our leaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, hold on, Rob!&rdquo; cried Merritt, suddenly;
&ldquo;look! that train&rsquo;s almost at the crossing now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I just saw the headlight among
the trees,&rdquo; echoed Tubby; &ldquo;better slow down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; assented Rob, as the thunder of
the approaching train was borne plainly to their
ears. It was evidently, as they had guessed, a
night freight, and from the noise the locomotive
was making it must have been a big one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woo-oo-oo-ough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the whistle. I guess there are
no gates ahead,&rdquo; said Merritt. &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our
chance to sneak upon those other fellows, they&mdash;Gee
whiz, look at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the other auto, which had hesitated
for an instant as the whistle of the approaching
train sounded, dashed on ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to try to beat the train to the
crossing,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never do it,&rdquo; was Merritt&rsquo;s rejoinder.
&ldquo;Look! Oh, good gracious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound of splintering wood and ripped mechanism
drowned his cry of horror, and those of
the other lads. Before their very eyes the locomotive
had struck the robbers&rsquo; car as it was half
way across the tracks and had tossed it to one
side&mdash;a mass of kindling wood and twisted metal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>&ldquo;They must both be injured or killed,&rdquo; cried
Rob; &ldquo;hurry, fellows, maybe we can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys jumped out of the auto and ran to
the crossing. In the meantime the engine had
been brought to a standstill and the train crew
were examining the wreck. But although both
the railroad men and the boys made a thorough
search, they could find no trace of the men who
had occupied the machine. Rob and Merritt, as
a final recourse, walked some distance back up
the track, but without finding any evidence that
there had been loss of life or injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been thrown clear of the auto
when the crash came, and when they picked themselves
up I guess they realized that the best
thing to do was to take themselves off,&rdquo; was the
way Rob explained it. Hardly had he completed
this theory of what had occurred when his foot
struck something. It gave out a metallic ring.
Stooping down swiftly, he picked it up and found
that it was the tin box from the bank, battered
and dented, indeed, but intact and still locked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>Naturally the boys were delighted over their
find, which must have been thrown from the
auto when it was demolished. As after half an
hour more of searching nothing was to be found
of Dugan or the Jap, the train crew went back
to their train and the boys prepared to turn back,
with what pleasant anticipations may be imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so long, kids,&rdquo; shouted the conductor
of the train after the long line of cars rolled off,
&ldquo;too lucky to happen a second time, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, he referred to the fact that no
loss of life or injury had occurred in the smash-up,
but to the boys his words had an added meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too lucky to happen a second time,&rdquo; said
Rob, hugging the precious tin box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BOLT FROM THE BLUE.</span></h2>
<p>Rob woke late the next day. For a few minutes
it seemed to him that he must have dreamed
all that had occurred the night before, but Lieutenant
Duvall&rsquo;s voice from the room below speedily
undeceived him. He recalled it all now&mdash;how
his father and an astonished crowd of
townsfolk had met them on their return from
that wild auto ride; how, on the box being
opened, it had been found to contain the plans
of the highly valued invention, of the exclusive
possession of which Japan had been so anxious
to deprive the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob, are you awake,&rdquo; came his father&rsquo;s voice
up the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself for sleeping
so late,&rdquo; was the lad&rsquo;s rejoinder. &ldquo;Gee whiz,
half-past nine! I&rsquo;ll be down in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>The lad was bathed and dressed in record time,
and in a few minutes over the promised time
made his appearance in the living-room. Lieutenant
Duvall rose and greeted him warmly, as
he came in. He overwhelmed the boy with his
thanks and congratulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fine act&mdash;a splendid thing to do,&rdquo;
he said, enthusiastically. &ldquo;Mr. Blake, you certainly
ought to be proud of such a boy. Rob, I
have sent a telegram to Washington to-day.
Won&rsquo;t you come out to the experiment station
with me and watch some flights while we wait
for an answer?&rdquo; Then seeing the puzzled look
on Rob&rsquo;s face, he broke into a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the telegram concerns you
and your plucky young chums. The Department
will not pass such bravery by without taking official
notice of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>Rob colored with pleasure as he accepted the
invitation. After a hasty breakfast they set out
in the officer&rsquo;s auto. On the way Merritt and
Tubby were called for, and it was a happy party
that went spinning over the road toward the
old mansion. The air was clear and still, the
sea smooth and sparkling under a cloudless sky,
and in the atmosphere was the promise of summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect day for flights,&rdquo; said the lieutenant,
&ldquo;and a perfect day to try a few bomb-dropping
experiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t blown up the old Vesper
yet?&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She holds together as if she were built
of steel instead of wood. I tell you what, we
ought to make this day a memorable one; I&rsquo;ve
got an idea in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Rob, watching the officer&rsquo;s
twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, the French claim that the
Englishman is wont to remark, &lsquo;By Jove, a fine
day; let&rsquo;s go out and kill something.&rsquo; Now, I
am going to parody that and say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day,
let&rsquo;s blow up something!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow up the Vesper,&rdquo; cried Tubby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. If we can hit her. I&rsquo;ve a notion to
try it myself. By Jove, I will,&rdquo; went on the officer,
warming to his subject. &ldquo;I want badly to
try out a new cordite bomb we&rsquo;ve been making
this winter, and here&rsquo;s my chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, old Vesper,&rdquo; breathed Rob, tragically,
extending his arm in the direction in which
the two melancholy-looking bare masts of the
schooner could be seen looming up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say good-bye yet,&rdquo; chuckled the officer;
&ldquo;I might miss her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The War Department had lost no time in replying
to Lieutenant Duvall&rsquo;s message describing
the boys&rsquo; courage and enterprise in securing the
papers stolen from the shattered safe. It was
brought to the officer by an orderly almost as
soon as they reached the De Regny place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I read it out?&rdquo; asked the officer, with a
smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll make your ears burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys began to protest, much to the amusement
of several officers gathered in what had
once been the dining room of the old mansion,
but Lieutenant Duvall nevertheless read in a
loud, clear voice the following:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are instructed to thank lads mentioned
in dispatch on behalf of the Secretary of War.
Splendid work. More substantial reward (the
Special Honor Medal) will follow. Hills, secretary
to the Secretary of War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; breathed Tubby, and then turned
very red as a perfect gale of laughter followed
his sincere expression of amazement, gratitude
and delight&mdash;all rolled into one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; breathed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe it,&rdquo; echoed Merritt, giving
himself a surreptitious pinch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, to lunch,&rdquo; laughed the lieutenant,
&ldquo;and after that, good&mdash;bye to the Vesper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye to the Vesper,&rdquo; echoed his brother
officers, who knew of the program for the afternoon.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It was about two-thirty o&rsquo;clock, and the sea
was unrippled except for the lazy Atlantic heave,
when a small launch left Hampton Harbor and
sped eastward through the Inlet and then out
into the open sea. She rapidly skirted the coast
and it was not long before the little craft was
past Topsail Island, and on the left hand of her
four occupants, the dark trees surrounding the
De Regny mansion were visible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>Seaward from the desolate looking place,
above which, however, the stars and stripes
floated with a bright dash of color, could be seen
the two bare masts of the wreck, and this was
apparently the objective point of the small launch,
for as they neared her one of the men in her
stern-seat half rose and, pointing, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is now. In half an hour we&rsquo;ll know
if Hank was telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was he this morning when you called
up the hospital?&rdquo; asked Bill Bender of the first
speaker, who was Stonington Hunt.</p>
<p>The other shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,&rdquo; he
added with a crafty look in his eyes; &ldquo;if we find
this money we don&rsquo;t need to tell Hank anything
about it. We&rsquo;ll just split it among ourselves.
He&rsquo;ll never leave that bed in the hospital, and it&rsquo;s
just as well for us he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there a minute, Mr. Hunt,&rdquo; said Bill
Bender; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t consent to that. Hank was
pretty square with us and we&rsquo;ll be square with
him. He&rsquo;ll get his share of the money if it&rsquo;s
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo; remonstrated Stonington
Hunt, in his smooth, crafty voice; &ldquo;he cannot use
it and we can. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; interrupted Freeman Hunt,
the youngest member of the party, who had been
sitting forward; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that over there by the
mansion? See, it&rsquo;s rising into the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an aeroplane!&rdquo; burst out his father;
&ldquo;bother it all, I hope they don&rsquo;t come flying out
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a nuisance,&rdquo; agreed Jack Curtiss,
watching like the others the graceful evolutions
of the white-winged flying machine as it rose
from amid the dark trees and began to circle
about like a gliding hawk.</p>
<p>All at once it made a lofty sweep and then
started off in a straight line toward the Vesper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, she&rsquo;s coming out to sea!&rdquo; cried Freeman,
delightedly, lost in admiration. &ldquo;Say, she&rsquo;s
a dandy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the thing can fly,&rdquo; admitted his father,
grudgingly, &ldquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;why, what&rsquo;s that fellow
in her doing? He&rsquo;s unfastening something. A
black object that is hanging down under the seat.
It&rsquo;s a round thing. It looks like&mdash;like&mdash;<i>a bomb</i>!
Great Scott! He&rsquo;s going to blow the Vesper up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; sneered Jack Curtiss, but his face was
very pale. As for Bill Bender and Freeman
Hunt, they said nothing, but watched the aeroplane
soaring far above them with open mouths
and staring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shout to him! Call to him!&rdquo; raved Stonington
Hunt. &ldquo;Tell him there is money on board
her. Don&rsquo;t let him blow that schooner up.
Hey-y-y-y-y!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distracted man, crazed by the thought of
being cheated out of his golden prey at the last
minute, stood erect in the boat and waved his
arms frantically, but if the figure guiding the
flying machine even saw him it gave no sign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>Now the aeroplane was right above the Vesper.
The fascinated watchers in the boat could
see the flying man&rsquo;s arm move. Then, like a
tiny shoe button&mdash;a little black shoe button&mdash;something
dropped from the big, white airship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone! Gone!&rdquo; almost shrieked Stonington
Hunt, as he saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; growled Jack Curtiss,
his eyes, like those of the others, fixed upon the
falling black sphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s not a real bomb, just a practice
one, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Bill Bender, hopefully,
when there came a shock through the air that
threatened to drive their ear drums in. Sea and
sky seemed to rock. Before their startled sight
the old wreck rose above the surface of the water
as if a giant hand had impelled her, and then
settled back as slowly as a harpooned whale. The
next instant an immense cloud of vapor arose
and swelled to a waving, yellowish pillar in the
still air. At the same moment, a mighty reverberating
&ldquo;boom&rdquo; reached their ears. Above the
destruction it had wrought the aeroplane wheeled
like a phoenix.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>As they gazed, its occupant waved his hand.
To Stonington Hunt it seemed that it was a
mocking gesture. He fairly snarled, drawing
back his lips till his teeth were exposed like a
wolf&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beaten again, and by blind fate, too!&rdquo; he
raved, tearing his hair in his extravagant fury
and doing all manner of frenzied things. Even
Jack Curtiss and Bill Bender were disgusted at
his exhibition of childish rage, and sternly told
him to control himself.</p>
<p>As a sort of forlorn hope the launch was run
up close to where the Vesper had been last seen,
but nothing remained of her but a few timbers
floating around on the surface. Some of them
were blackened and splintered where the cordite
had riven them. The well-aimed bomb had done
its work well. The hunters for Hank&rsquo;s secreted
loot were cheated of their treasure trove by the
strangest combination of circumstances that ever
frustrated a knavish plot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>But Stonington Hunt had, as he had remarked,
still a trump card to play. And when the next
day it came to his ears that the Boy Scouts had
been present at the destruction of the Vesper he
was more determined than ever to use it. Going
to a small safe in his room, he drew from it certain
papers, armed with which, he started for
Paul Perkins&rsquo;s place. He found Mrs. Perkins
sweeping the front steps and greeted her with
a low bow and a flourish of his hat. Mrs. Perkins
feared and disliked Stonington Hunt, and
would have avoided him if she could, but before
she could say anything the man had pushed
through the gate and was beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mrs. Perkins,&rdquo; he said, with
great effusiveness; &ldquo;I have called to give Paul
one last chance to sell me the rights in that machine
of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do it, I&rsquo;m sure, sir. There is no use
your bothering,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins. &ldquo;He&mdash;oh,
here he comes now,&rdquo; as Paul came round the
corner of the house; &ldquo;Paul, here&rsquo;s Mr. Hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Paul, with no very noticeable cordiality
in his tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve come to see if you are prepared to
sell the machine to me now,&rdquo; said Hunt, with an
odd ring in his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot, as I told you before,&rdquo; said Paul,
firmly. &ldquo;I have my reasons, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mine,&rdquo; snapped Hunt, a savage light
appearing in his eyes. He whipped a hand into
his breast pocket and produced a handful of
papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Perkins,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;are you prepared
to pay me the interest on this mortgage?
It amounts to $1,500.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why,&rdquo; stammered Mrs. Perkins, &ldquo;you
have no mortgage on this house. It&rsquo;s Landis,
the real estate man. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bought the mortgage from him, madam,&rdquo;
was the rejoinder, &ldquo;and I am now here to claim
my property unless the interest is paid up at once.
Of course, I am willing to take the sole rights
to that machine in lieu of the interest. I think
I&rsquo;m giving you a good chance; are you willing
to take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must,&rdquo; hesitated Mrs. Perkins;
&ldquo;oh, dear, this is dreadful. Paul, my boy, will
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>But Paul had vanished mysteriously some minutes
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do, sir,&rdquo; she stammered,
almost weeping, &ldquo;I cannot pay the mortgage
now. Will you not wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another day, madam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; came a quiet voice from
behind them. It was Paul. With him were the
three Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay off that mortgage now, Mr. Hunt,&rdquo;
he went on as Rob, Tubby and Merritt broke into
broad smiles at the expression of baffled fury on
Hunt&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;Mother, we
are rich. Mr. Merrill has disposed of the Motor-Scooter
idea to the government. He sent me a
check for five thousand dollars yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Paul, you never told me!&rdquo; cried his
mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to till I could be sure I wasn&rsquo;t
dreaming,&rdquo; laughed Paul, happily. &ldquo;Now, then,
Mr. Hunt, how much is that mortgage for, and
we&rsquo;ll go before a notary and I&rsquo;ll pay it up&mdash;every
penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt&rsquo;s hands quivered so that he could hardly
control them. In his agitation and rage he let
fall to the ground one of his papers. It was
Tubby who picked it up. On it Mr. Hunt&rsquo;s not
overclean thumb had left a large imprint. The
fat boy&rsquo;s eyes lit up as he gazed at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give that paper back, you young whipper-snapper!&rdquo;
demanded Stonington Hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till I&rsquo;ve compared it with something else,&rdquo;
was the quiet rejoinder.</p>
<p>And very leisurely Tubby drew from his
pocket something wrapped in paper. This, on
being uncovered, proved to be a bit of wood
smelling strongly of kerosene.</p>
<p>The rotund youth compared the thumb-print
on the papers and the one upon the bit of wood
with quiet deliberation, while the others looked
breathlessly on. They could not imagine what
was coming. Stonington Hunt could, though,
for his face was pale and the sweat stood on his
brow in shiny beads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to give that paper back?&rdquo; he
demanded in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when I&rsquo;ve got a warrant for your arrest
for setting fire to Paul Perkins&rsquo;s wagon house,&rdquo;
was the quiet rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;you&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; exclaimed
Hunt, but his eyes were wild and staring
and he seemed about to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that the thumb-print on this bit of oil-soaked
wood and your thumb-print on this paper
are the same,&rdquo; declared Tubby. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
think so, we&rsquo;ll go to the magistrate and let him
decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, no! Mercy!&rdquo; howled Stonington
Hunt, suddenly losing all his bravado and sinking
on his knees. &ldquo;Be merciful. Don&rsquo;t prosecute
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet and listen,&rdquo; said Tubby, in the same
judicial voice, while his companions gazed on,
amazed at the stern expression of the ordinarily
careless, good-natured lad&rsquo;s tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tear up that mortgage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh, yes! Give it to me and you will see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; said Tubby, tearing off the bit
of paper with the thumb print on it; &ldquo;I need this.
Now, then, tear the rest up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t prosecute if I do?&rdquo; wailed the
groveling wretch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; promised Paul; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve no wish to be
hard on you, badly as you have treated us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hunt, with trembling hands, tore the paper into
tiny shreds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better burn those,&rdquo; said Tubby, turning
to Paul. &ldquo;Now, then, Mr. Hunt, you had better
get out of here,&rdquo; he went on to the unmasked
rascal. &ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and thank you,&rdquo; rejoined the humbled,
quaking man in a trembling tone. He started
for the gate. As he reached it a boyish figure
came swinging along the street; it was Freeman
Hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hullo, dad,&rdquo; he said, as he stopped, disdaining
to notice the boys; &ldquo;how ill you look.
What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my boy. Perhaps the sun is a little
warm,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I have a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better come up to the house. Sister
is starting for Maine to visit those friends
this afternoon. She wants to say good-bye to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, my boy, and, Freeman, while I think
of it, we may as well pack up and go, too. The
climate of Hampton does not agree with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Well, the tale is told. That little trip of Stonington
Hunt&rsquo;s extended into weeks, and the
weeks into months, and he never came back.
Finally his house was sold and the place knew
him no more. In the meantime, affairs at Hampton
had been progressing much in the usual way.
Paul, in due course, received his other five thousand
dollars, which was deposited in the bank,
the institution having been completely remodeled
in the course of repairing the damage wrought
by the blowing up of the big safe. And of the
part the Motor-Scooter played in the conquest
of the Pole, the papers have told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<p>Nothing more was ever heard of Dugan or
the Japanese, although it was said some time
ago in a Tokio dispatch that an American named
Dugan had been shot in a quarrel with one of the
Mikado&rsquo;s officers. As for Hank Handcraft, he
recovered from his lingering illness and was discharged
from the hospital, a wreck of the man
he had been. On leaving the place he declared
his intention of going to see some relatives in
England and of spending the remainder of his
days there, but whether he did so, or from whom
he procured the funds for the trip, the present
writer is not informed.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of my readers would like to know
what became of Sim. Well, Sim has a job doing
odd tasks for Cap. Hudgins out on Topsail Island.
Previous to undertaking these duties for the
good-hearted captain Sim had another job, but
he did not hold it long.</p>
<p>His employer, a well-to-do man in the town,
met Sim the first morning he came to work and
thereafter did not see him for two whole days.
Finally Sim was discovered asleep in the barn on
a soft truss of hay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, have you been sleeping ever since I hired
you?&rdquo; asked Sim&rsquo;s new employer indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not come, sir, of a hard-working race,&rdquo;
rejoined Sim, still with his old habit strong upon
him; &ldquo;your &lsquo;ad&rsquo; said, &lsquo;Boy wanted to sleep on the
place.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>One afternoon in early June there were unwonted
doings in Hampton. The annual Firemen&rsquo;s
Carnival was on, with a parade of Boy
Scouts as a special feature. Big crowds lined
the streets on foot, in buggies and in autos to see
the big parade pass under the flaunting banners
and decorations.</p>
<p>The cheers were loud and long for the firemen
of the different villages as they swung by
with their equipment, but presently a shout went
down the line of spectators:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here come the Boy Scouts!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>What a shout arose then! The others sounded
no louder than a pop-gun beside a cannon, compared
to it. Headed by a band playing a lively
quick-step the serried ranks of bright young faces
and well set-up figures went swinging by, keeping
perfect step. At the head of the Eagle division,
with its green and black standard, came our
young friends. On the breast of each, besides
their Red Honors, glittered three brand new gold
medals, the gift of the War Department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Boy Scouts&rsquo; organization surely is a fine
thing for those youngsters,&rdquo; remarked Lieutenant
Duvall to Mr. Blake, as the two stood outside the
bank and watched the spectacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Blake. &ldquo;It is going
to make good men of them, too,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>And here, with the blare of martial music in
our ears and before our eyes the sight of row
upon row of orderly, nattily-uniformed boys
swinging by to the lively air of &ldquo;The Boy
Scouts&rsquo; March,&rdquo; we will for the present take
leave of our friends of the Eagle Patrol, to resume
their acquaintance in another volume of
this series, in which their further adventures and
exciting doings will be related in full. This volume
I shall call, &ldquo;THE BOY SCOUTS&rsquo; MOUNTAIN
CAMP.&rdquo;</p>
